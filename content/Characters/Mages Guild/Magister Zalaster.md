#### Faction
[[Mages Guild]], Exarch-Mage
#### Location
[[Dor Dalla]], Guild of Mages
#### Background
Zalaster was previously a high ranking and adequately skilled mage in High Rock who petitioned to take over the chapterhouse in Lyithdonea after the unfortunate demise of the last Exarch-Mage. His request and (on paper anyway) promotion was granted in part due to the aggravation he had caused some peers with his reckless behavior. So he was put somewhere out of the way. He does have a lot of experience with summoning daedra, so he is qualified for the job.
#### Personality
An excitable fellow who is not very cautious. He has a passionate desire to learn, experiment, and trust novices with dangerous duties. His associates are frustrated by the reckless behavior he often encourages with students.
#### Dialogue

> [!CITE] [[Azura]]
> In [[Lyithdonea]], "[[Azura]]" might refer to either the Daedra Prince [[Azura]] or the [[Azura City|City of Azura]], capitol seat of [[House Azura]]. If you hadn't guessed it by now, [[Azura]] has an undeniable level of influence over this archipelago.

| House Azura | [[Magister Zalaster]] | The political organization which rules Lyithdonea. House Azura's government and majority of their population is primarily situated in the capitol of Lyithdonea: the City of Azura. They may look like Altmer, but they're actually an extant sect of Chimer. If you want to learn more, we have a copy of A History of House Azura in the library here -- though I would caution you to digest its contents with a grain of salt. It's laced with religious myths. You may also find copies of Finding the Rose but I wouldn't bother with that rubbish. Recruitment propaganda. |

| [[@Lyithdonea]] | [[Magister Zalaster]] | Did you travel across the Padomaic Ocean with naught but sailor's tales to prepare you for your arrival? Well, I won't bore you with details or the obvious but Lyithdonea, or the Azurian Isles as it's sometimes called, is under the control of House Azura. The Empire has not shown much interest in properly conquering it. During the Invasion of Akavir, Lyithdonea was not a strategic target. And since that disaster, the Empire has been more focused on consolidation rather than expansion. However, there was a period of open commerce between Lyithdonea and Tamriel during the second era when some of the Imperial guilds established guildhalls here. As you can see, the Mages Guild is still active. The Fighters Guild's enterprise was not quite so successful. ^Lyithdonea |

| Order of the Lamp | [[Magister Zalaster]] | The knightly Order of the Lamp's primary duties revolve around guild security. You'll see them patrolling the grounds, enforcing the rules, and keeping an ear to the ground for anything which could negatively impact the guild. I'll give you some friendly advice to watch your behavior around them. They don't report to me. |

| Ouag Tong | [[Magister Zalaster]] | The Ouag Tong is an independent cult-faction based in the southern isles. They do not have direct ties with the Ouamer of the region, but reside on peaceful terms. To describe them in short, they are obsessed with water; “oua this”, “oua that”. I really can’t understand much of what they jabber about if you try conversing with one of them. |

| someone in particular | [[Magister Zalaster]]; Same Faction == 0 | Magister Crim in the main hall is the Master of Initiates. If you want to join the Lyithdonea Mages Guild, you'll need to convince him that you're the right material. Magister Reeh-Fen is upstairs with his cosmological apparatuses -- unless he left a mirror behind again. Illusionists... the other Magisters will be around the campus somewhere and the staff and students likewise. You're free to explore the grounds. |
