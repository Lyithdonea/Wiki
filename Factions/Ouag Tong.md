*The Ouag Tong are a “Divers” or “Swimmers” Guild. At their core, they are dedicated to the preservation of artifacts both rare and mundane found in the waters and shores of the world and the conservation of water-based life. They strive for balance. They have strong ties to the Maormer; particularly a separatist sect of Maormer who inhabited [[Lyithdonea]] before it was colonized by [[House Azura]]; and they carry on the same ideals held by that extinct faction. The faction is primarily comprised of Chimer due to geographic location - not creed - and they welcome members of all races into their ranks. They are politically neutral and do not involve themselves in the events of the primary Lyithdonea main quest.*

"...the main hall of their headquarters boasts a large mural of a serpentine creature contorted in a wave-like pattern over an ocean blue field..." [[Notes on the Ouag Tong]]
#### Ranks
* Wetfoot
* Swimmer
* Searcher
* Guardian
* Ouashoki

Each rank up in the guild gets you some special equipment mainly focused on allowing water breathing and increasing swift swim. And maybe the player could get some unique things (either as rewards or as treasures) which are scripted to be more potent underwater. Like a trident that fortifies attack underwater. Maybe I could hook into MGEXE for another facemask artifact which reduces the underwater fog. And then there is the cephalomancy skill line as well...
#### Motivations (Main Storyline)
Observation tells us that the Ouag Tong has no direct involvement with or concern in the brewing conflict. For one reason or another they watch.
