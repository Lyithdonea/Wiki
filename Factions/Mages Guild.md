#### Motivations (Main Storyline)
The guild of mages is primarily interested in the conflict from an academic perspective. They are highly interested in the polyliths and the metaphysical implications of a daedric conflict. They care little for the internal chimer politics as long as it doesnâ€™t affect their charter to stay on the isles to conduct study.
