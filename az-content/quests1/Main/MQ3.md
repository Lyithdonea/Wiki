Before hiring the player, the [[ha-questgiver-1|HA Questgiver 1]] wants them to investigate a scuffle down in the [[azura-city|Azura City]] Underworks to prove their worth. Someone is dead and the killer is no where to be found. The disturbing thing is the bloodless state of the corpse. Interview nearby observers for clues (spoiler: it was cult activity). The player then reports back but when they return, the [[ha-questgiver-1|HA Questgiver 1]] is gone. Instead they find a note left behind on his desk ordering the player to bring their findings to [[rashyon-daga|Rashyon Daga]] at the Rosery along with a signed recommendation to join House Azura, directing the player to [[ha-questgiver-2|HA Questgiver 2]].

If the player speaks to [[ha-questgiver-2|HA Questgiver 2]] and joins House Azura, then it will kick off that questline with [[HAQ1]].
