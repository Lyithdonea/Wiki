| Tablet of Magnus          | In the Trial of Vivec, Vivec mentions that the Tribunal worked from the drafts of Magnus to achieve godhood. Perhaps, I should have an obscure mage in the isles who possesses a manuscript (more like a glowing rune-tablet) produced by the et’Ada of Magic, Magnus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Magicka Edge Axe          | ...good hits with the Magicka Edge Axe convert some of her magicka into extra damage. Very powerful weapon, even more powerful than Lakvan's Daedric Axe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Wraithmail                | Generic wraithmail armor (related to, but a generic version of Alandro Sul's armor): *“It was common before the exodus to bind the ectoplasmic and ashy remains of our Ancestors into enchanted rings, finally fashioning them into ringmail armor known as Wraithmail. The armor was known to protect the wearer from ordinary weapons and was as close as one could get to their ancestors while they yet breathed.”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| King Orgnum’s Coffer      | I should include King Orgnum’s Coffer in the isles (possibly in the possession of the Ouag Tong) since it is one of the only known Maormeri artifacts: *“King Orgnum's Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers clue to it's true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orgnum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery.”* |
| Ichor of winged twilights | Can be found mainly in the daedric shrines. Maybe a black market item in the isles? It is a black liquid that smells “cold, like eucalyptus or mint”. It is used in levitation potions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Band of the Mussitate     | A ring found on a dead Refulgent Erudite in the caverns of Dawn. Casts silence on target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Crystal Rose              | Are fashioned from the frozen burst of a “falling star”. Remember that although the meteoric material originates from Aetherius, it must pass through Oblivion to get to Nirn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Orange Ward               | An artifact from Infernace which grants complete protection from fire damage. Probably for a short time - good for avoiding traps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| K'kelli Mask              | A magical mask worn by the Nolmer which is said to be fashioned using the soul of a Magna Ge. Grants some powerful star magic (is probably mostly ineffectual for the player if they acquire one).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| "City Factions" | Have some city-type factions such as an Acrobatic Camp or a Prostitutes Guildhouse. Or maybe a school dedicated to one skill, such as security or athletics. Remember that Azura is worshipped, but the other daedra are still honored and the brothel could serve Sanguine whose sphere is hedonistic debauchery. |
