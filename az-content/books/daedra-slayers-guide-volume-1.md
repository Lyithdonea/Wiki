## Introduction  
Daedra hail from the hellish plane of Oblivion. They are most often encountered in Tamriel as a result of sorcerous summoning. Something most common folk have little experience with. But the astute adventurer will arm themselves with the knowledge necessary for defeating these otherworldly foes. This comprehensive series of guides, compiled by a veteran Daedra-slayer, will provide the necessary tips and secrets for defeating the most common types of daedra.  
## Prologue  
This first guide will deal with three of the most frequently encountered daedra. These daedra are the minions of Mehrunes Dagon: the pesky Scamp, the saurian Clannfear, and the noble yet deadly Dremora.  
## Scamp
The neophyte adventurer will undoubtedly encounter this agile creature in a dungeon romp or as the hostile summon of a novice conjurer. Although the proficient warrior could simply slay this beast with the flick of a wrist, we will assume that the fighter is green as a raw sheet of volcanic glass. Although some particular strains of Scamp are capable of casting magical bursts (such as the Burning Scamp or Ducal Scamps), magical skill is particularly infrequent among them. I have found that all Scamps tend to follow the same method of attack, the charge followed by mindlessly beating on the armor of the besieged. Generally, there is time to consider many different battle plans as the Scamp rushes toward the combatant. However, through my early years of fighting these daedra I developed the most efficient technique. As the charging Scamp is nearly close enough to flay flesh, roll or step to the side and return a back-handed slash towards the Daedroth’s backside. This tactic will almost invariably work, leaving the Scamp wounded before the scuffle has even begun. Now that the Scamp is vulnerable, traditional blocking / parrying / thrusting rules apply. If the fighter is a dexterous marksman or mage, melee combat can easily be avoided by simply outrunning the beast and sending projectiles its way.  
## Clannfear
The Clannfear is a strange creation of Dagon which resembles a creature of our own plane more than a daedra. However, upon slaying a Clannfear and inspecting its ephemeral remains, it becomes quite clear they do not originate from Nirn. Clannfear are infrequently summoned by sorcerers simply because they have the beastly habit of nipping at their masters out of boredom. This tendency may be mundane in the Deadlands, but it can be quite harmful to fleshy mortals. Therefore these daedra are more often encountered as solitary guardians of daedric ruins or shrines.  
  
Skirmishes with Clannfear are often initiated by the creature itself. I have found them to be frustratingly sneaky s’wits. Take care when fighting Clannfears with swords or spears as their scaly hide is quite resistant to piercing attacks. Clannfear do however possess a weakness. After slaying a Clannfear, and examining its corpse, I discovered them to be surprisingly lightweight. It would seem that their bone-structure resembles the cliffracers of Vvardenfell Island, which would attribute to their light-footedness. This anatomical aspect can be exploited while fighting the beast. If the fighter has some skill in blunt weapons, a warhammer or even a small mace have proven to be exceptionally deadly when directed at a Clannfear. The intense blows from these weapons will quickly crush the bones of the Daedroth, rendering it helpless.  
  
Ordindary Clannfear have no magical abilities to speak of and so require no complex strategy to banish.  
## Dremora
Dremora are one of the most complex daedra I have ever encountered throughout my questing days. Because so much has already been documented regarding their peculiar behavior and clan mentality, this guide will keep to the not-so-simple task of besting a Dremora in combat.  
  
Caution. Caution is required when advancing on a Dremora. Oftentimes they will wait until the last moment to attack their enemy, luring with curiosity. Although some friendly (or at least tolerant Dremora) have been recorded, mainly within the Tribunal Temple, most are hostile and will guard their charge to the death of their corporeal manifestations.  
  
Defeating a Dremora is a simple but deadly accomplishment. They may be approached much in the same way you would assault any man or mer. Their fighting style varies little from the mortal races. Perhaps this is meant to surprise the unwary. Take care though, as they tend to cast a Shield around themselves to stem off physical bludgeoning. Scrolls or spells of Dispel can remove this effect if the traveler can afford them. On the other hand, prudence is advised when casting spells against the daedra as their angular, unnatural armor seems to inherently reflect some spells back at the caster.  
  
Little additional guidance can be given other than to brush up on your weapon or archaic skill of choice and wear appropriate armor for the encounter. Also remember that Dremora usually attack with powerful weapons which lack enchantment, but most often they do not carry a shield. Exploit this when possible by remaining always on the offensive.
