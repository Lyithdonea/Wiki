## Introduction  
Daedra hail from the hellish plane of Oblivion. They are most often encountered in Tamriel as a result of sorcerous summoning. Something most common folk have little experience with. But the astute adventurer will arm themselves with the knowledge necessary for defeating these otherworldly foes. This comprehensive series of guides, compiled by a veteran Daedra-slayer, will provide the necessary tips and secrets for defeating the most common types of daedra.  
## Prologue  
This guide details the most capable methods for felling the atronachs of Oblivion. There are many varying types of Atronachs, this guide will discuss the three most prevalent varieties. The method of defeating Atronachs varies only slightly, mainly due to differing elemental affiliations, so pay close attention. Also, do not confuse Atronachs with simple golems which are magical or mechanical in nature, not Daedric.  
## Flame Atronach
Flame Atronachs are often encountered in subterranean lava caverns where they brood on gods know what. Even if startled, tussling with a Flame Atronach can be a hassle. The health-conscious battler must be carefully aware not to make bodily contact with the daedroth. A Flame Atronach’s surface is composed of a thick, nearly magmatic fluid, contained by the creature’s life essence. Touching their flesh will result in severe burning; In fact, even getting too close to the Atronach can be wounding, as they tend to emanate random sprays of flame. Unless the adventurer cares little for comeliness, it is highly recommended that the attacker wear a full set of armor, especially covering the entire face.  
  
The physical dangers of battling a Flame Atronach are only the beginning of the hardships. This Daedroth should only be tackled by those of strong arm and firm resilience. They are not any easy foe. Before entering battle with a Flame Atronach, the clever fighter will be sure to bring along a trinket of Spell Absorption, or something which strongly resists elemental fire. Especially in tight quarters it is nearly impossible to dodge an atronach’s fireball. Due to the unstable condition of these Daedra, their elemental projections explode on impact with any surface. Therefore, if you stand in front of a wall, regardless whether you are agile enough to dodge the flame bolt; it will explode behind you and have an immensely detrimental effect on your peace of mind.  
  
Flame Atronachs tend to continue blasting magicka until their reserves are depleted, then resort to melee. One simple preparatory tactic which I have employed against Atronachs is to cast a strong spell or read an enchanted scroll of Spell Absorption right before the Atronach begins unleashing its volley. For the duration of the spell the combatant is free to choose his own approach. A battlemage may choose to send magicka back at the daedra (obviously Frost spells are the most potent) or a warrior could begin hacking it. However, the accurate Marksman has an advantage here. If an arrow is released directly into the path of the flame bolt, then the orb will ignite prematurely leaving the bowman unharmed.  
  
Whichever method is chosen and if the daedra survives up to this point, it will soon run out of magicka and will charge. If this occurs, the principles laid out in the first paragraph apply regarding touching the Atronach. Utmost caution is proposed at this point, but felling the beast is only a matter of attacking it.  
## Frost Atronach
So you wish to learn how to defeat a Frost Atronach… cleanly and efficiently. Be wary, this cold-hearted Daedra will approach your death in the same manner. Come armed with fireballs if you will, only be cautious. As do all Atronachs, the icy variety come equipped with the ability to Reflect spells back at the caster.  
  
Similar to a Flame Atronach, a Frost Atronach’s outer surface can be harmful to the combatant. However, much less caution is required in this encounter than the former, at least regarding physical contact. Wearing thick gloves and a full helm to protect against the daedra’s icy breath will help protect against a hellish frostbite.  
  
Allow me to copy the paragraph from above to illustrate defending against the icy bursts which the Frost Atronachs unleash: "The physical dangers of battling a \[Frost\] Atronach are only the beginning of the hardships. This Daedroth should only be tackled by those of strong arm and firm resilience. They are not any easy foe. Before entering battle with a \[Frost\] Atronach, the clever fighter will be sure to bring along a trinket of Spell Absorption, or something which strongly resists elemental \[frost\]. Especially in tight quarters it is nearly impossible to dodge an atronach’s \[frostball\]. Due to the unstable condition of these Daedra, their elemental projections explode on impact with any surface. Therefore, if you stand in front of a wall, regardless whether you are agile enough to dodge the \[frost\]bolt; it will explode behind you and have an immensely detrimental effect on your peace of mind.  
  
\[Frost\] Atronachs tend to continue blasting magicka until their reserves are depleted, then resort to melee. One simple preparatory tactic which I have employed against Atronachs is to cast a strong spell or read an enchanted scroll of Spell Absorption right before the Atronach begins unleashing its volley. For the duration of the spell the combatant is free to choose his own approach. A battlemage may choose to send magicka back at the daedra (obviously \[Flame\]spells are the most potent) or a warrior could begin hacking it. However, the accurate Marksman has an advantage here. If an arrow is released directly into the path of the \[frost\]bolt, then the orb will ignite prematurely leaving the bowman unharmed."  
  
Now pay careful attention here because melee with a Frost Atronach is severely different than battling a Flame Atronach. Frost Atronachs are deceptive daedra and seek to best the daedra-slayer by upsetting their balance through unanticipated attacks. The Atronach may try to lure the attacker in closer by attacking with its hands at first. However, once the fighter is within range, I have found that they take great delight in swiftly extending a frosty icicle sword through the surprised combatant’s midsection. Be ever alert when close enough to the daedra for this to occur. If timed correctly the icicle can be dodged and then severed, injuring the Atronach.  
## Storm Atronach
Have you ever fought a floating, orbiting body of rock? No? Then you have never encountered a Storm Atronach. In the same manner as the preceding Atronachs, the Storm variety will also conjure bolts of magicka to destroy their attackers. The tactics for avoiding their bolts of lightning remain the same as before, just be sure to leave your wet clothes behind before getting struck by a shockbloom. I will not repeat myself once again so reread the previous paragraphs to obtain the knowledge you require.  
  
Once again however, melee combat with a Storm Atronach is not so simple. The warrior is advised to be either: extremely agile, equipped and proficient with a shield, arrayed in heavy armor, or best of all to possess all of these skills. The Storm Atronach is inherently a Daedric tempest spirit; the windy Daedra will gather rock and debris to take form in the mundus. The danger when facing a Storm Atronach is that it has complete control over every last orbiting pebble. Generally the daedra will take on a roughly humanoid form and bash the contestant with large boulder-hands. However in order to distract or injure, the Atronach will also send smaller rocks flying towards the adventurer. This is when armor and dodging become useful. The key to defeating a Storm Atronach is to club at it hard enough to knock it’s forming rocks away from the daedra’s core. This will render it weak enough to banish.
