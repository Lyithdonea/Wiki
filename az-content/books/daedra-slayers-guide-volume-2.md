## Introduction  
Daedra hail from the hellish plane of Oblivion. They are most often encountered in Tamriel as a result of sorcerous summoning. Something most common folk have little experience with. But the astute adventurer will arm themselves with the knowledge necessary for defeating these otherworldly foes. This comprehensive series of guides, compiled by a veteran Daedra-slayer, will provide the necessary tips and secrets for defeating the most common types of daedra.  
## Prologue  
This guide lists some of the random daedra which may be encountered in daedric ruins or shrines. And save one, they may also be fought as the summons of proficient conjurers.  
## Hunger
Boethiah’s sphere is treachery and deceit, crippling governments seemingly for pleasure. It follows that a servant of Boethiah would share this attitude of enfeebling. Here is my word of advice for those who stumble upon a Hunger Daedra; turn the other direction. Little good comes from slaying a hunger unless you are under contract to eradicate the beast. They have little of value recoverable from their physical bodies and the trouble they cause is hardly worth the effort.  
  
I say all this primarily because of the Hunger’s ability to disintegrate armor through their destructive magic and also their paralyzing touch. Belying its name, the Hunger has great reserves of magicka and will refrain from attacking at close range even if forced. Instead it will madly throw Daedric magic to obliterate your armor. Unless the adventurer has deep pockets indeed for repairing their equipment, they will want to bring wards of Spell Absorption or Reflection to repel the Hunger’s persistent volleys.  
The safest way for a warrior to defeat a Hunger is from a distance, dodging magical bolts and casting projectiles of their own after the daedroth. If marksmanship or magic is not your strongest asset, then melee combat may be inevitable. In the event that close combat must be commenced against a Hunger, take this advice. Prior to meeting the creature, remove your armor since the daedroth will not attack you until it is finished casting bolts, which quite often lasts until the end of the combat. This is one of the very few instances where removal of the armor is recommended, and it should only be practiced if no other daedra or creatures are within range of the fight. Once close enough to strike the Hunger, be careful to avoid its spiny extrusions. Sometimes, ancient Hungers have poisoned spines which have caused the death of many-an-adventurer.  
## Ogrim
The burly Ogrim could almost rightfully be mistaken for goblin-kin. The Daedric Prince Malacath shaped the Ogrims and they bear a familiar resemblance to the goblins and orcs of Tamriel. This fact is not as strange as it may seem initially, since Malacath is the patron lord of the Orcs.  
  
Enough narration however, let us speak of fighting an Ogrim. Since their intelligence is as wanting as a Hunger’s stomach, the Ogrim’s immense size is the largest obstacle to overcome here. Similar to the Hunger, the Ogrim can simply be defeated from a distance using projectiles; however its scaly hide can deflect many of the arrows. Melee with an Ogrim is equally difficult, Agility and accuracy are necessary. The Ogrim slowly lumbers about, so the best tactic to use against them is to dart in and out avoiding its crushing arms. If one is accurate enough to avoid the roll of its stomach, the legs are a vulnerable area to attack.  
  
A final caution is to evade being smothered by the beast’s girth against a wall. The daedroth favors this ploy, as it is then free to club the trapped mortal to death.  
## Spider Daedra
Many adventurers have never before encountered a Spider Daedra. One of the reasons for their rarity is the fact that they make poor summons, as they are nearly impossible to control; often mutilating their conjurer.  
  
Spider Daedra are the spawn of Mephala and their irrationality must initiate from her inexplicable whims. If forced into combat with a Spider Daedroth, there are two possible scenarios which I have found to be most effective. First, if you can distract the daedroth with something like a summoning or enemy (they often attack their own), then you will be free to attack them from behind as they seem to lack very wide attention spans. Or, if you can proficiently handle a shield, then it can help deflect the majority of the Spider Daedroth’s wildl blows. Stay on the defensive until a weak spot reveals itself or the Daedroth becomes distracted by another bystander.
