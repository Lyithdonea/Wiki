Esroniet was Conquered by Emperor Uriel V in 3E284. [^1] The island nation may have been yielded peacefully by Prince Bashomon. Black Harbor is a strategically critical settlement on the island and may also be the largest. When it was conquered in 3E282, the Empire immediately commenced renovations. [^2] The historical leader of Esroniet may have been a "Prince" since the named individual who surrendered the nation to the Empire was called Prince Bashomon. [^3] Natural or otherwise, Esroniet is known to weather bad storms and/or hurricanes. [^4]

> Since Esroniet was used as the launch site for the invasion of Akavir, Black Harbor would likely have been renovated to provide enough space to make very large transport ships including drydocks. This could potentially lead to houses there being built on stilts along with the construction of drainage canals and storm walls as a design feature.

With the disaster at Ionith, the Empire only maintained a weak control of Esroniet which, being the furthest island from Tamriel, quickly faltered and failed. This led to the rise of the [[padomaic-pirates|Padomaic "Black" Pirates]] to power in Black Harbor.

The indigenous population is primarily human and are descended from a combination of human refugees of Akavir with some mixture with the ancient nedes from Morrowind (i.e. "Men-of-Morrowind").

The interior of the island is home to towering silverleaf trees and hemp plants which were used to make timber and rope, respectively, for the Expeditionary Force. Ship building is still an important industry for Esroniet. Only now it is used to equip the economy of piracy. Sumac is also known to grow on the islands of Esroniet. 
## Factions
### Royalty
The royalty was allowed to remain after the pirates took over because they're an important religious symbol (and had the weight of tradition backing them up) but with little to no real authority; figureheads.
### Black Council
Previously an advisory body to the prince, nominally still an advisory body to the prince, but in reality the rulers of Esroniet. Composed of the heads of the clans; technically a seat on the council is what makes a clan a clan. Pre-Imperials it was composed of the same group of powerful families for a long time, but the pirates are more egalitarian/volatile, so social mobility is possible if a group becomes powerful enough. Additions are by majority vote of existing clan heads
### Clans
* **dir-Kannika** - Silverleaf
* **dir-Ralianus** - Tiger Moths. Named after their clan symbol, taken from their origins as soldiers in the Tigermoth Legion, which in turn was named after the moth native to Esroniet.
* **dir-Rikara** - Fish
* **dir-Zaraya** - Seabird

Within the clans, leadership is by selection. Choosing an heir from among blood descendents is common, but adoption and the selection of talented non-family is also common. In most cases the clan will accept the chosen heir of the previous incumbent, but they are not required to: after the death of a leader there is always a period where the clan might fragment if the chosen successor is not accepted.

Fealty is to the person of the leader, not to a title or the clan. This fealty is shown by adopting their name as your own. Someone who accepted the previous leader is not bound by honour to accept their successor, and may honourably withdraw from the clan on their death - but they will lose the privileges of nobility unless they're accepted by another clan.

When a clan changes leader, those nobles who accept the new leader will take the new name. Refusal to adopt the new name once the matter is settled is a renunciation of your membership of the clan.

In practice, most people will stay and swear fealty. Acceptance elsewhere isn't guaranteed, and although the system allows for transfer, there are usually binding ties to the original clan - family, friends, tradition, livelihood - that make it unpalatable.
### Indigenous Nobility
The indigenous nobility have mostly been impoverished and replaced by pirate chiefs. Some were killed off during the takeover, some have been reduced to utter poverty, some joined the pirates and maintained power, some that were impoverished have managed to claw back enough power to get on the council again.

Patents of nobility are granted by the Prince(ss), but the true mark of prestige is being able to claim a seat on the Black Council without being thrown out on your ear (or assassinated). Anyone with enough influence to claim a seat without a patent is likely to have enough influence to ensure they obtain a patent shortly thereafter.
### Indigenous Religious Sect
Primary deities are Kynareth, known locally as Kina, goddess of storms and stars (in the sense of navigation and of fate), patron of sailors and travelers, mistress of the natural world, and Zenithar, called Zenir locally, god of wealth and war, patron of soldiers, farmers, and craftsmen, master of artifice.
## Timeline
- 3E270 - Uriel V begins preparations for the invasion of Akavir with the conquest of islands in the Padomaic ocean
- 3E 282 - Black Harbour falls to Uriel V's invasion force
- 3E 284 - Prince Bashomon dir-Esroniet officially cedes sovereignty of Esroniet to Uriel V, after fighting a guerilla war for two years. He then commits suicide-by-royal-guard, leaving his daughter Mayusri princess of Esroniet, and a captive at Fort Tigermoth. Periodic rebellion by the Esri nobility continues, but it is harshly punished, and many of the old noble families are executed.
- 3E 285 - Naval expeditions sent to scout the coast of Akavir.
- 3E 286 - More naval expeditions.
- 3E 288 - The Expeditionary Force leaves Black Harbour and heads for Akavir.
- 3E 289 - Severe and violent storms. Disaster at Ionith. Uriel V dies in Akavir. 
- 3E 290 - The remains of the Expeditionary Force limp back to Black Harbor. Within short order the Elder Council orders their withdrawal, with one legion (and the wounded) to be left behind to heal and hold Esroniet. 
- 3E 290s - They left behind a garrison and went away amidst grand promises of returning for a second invasion of Akavir, but over the following years all that ever arrived was a handful of ships and more often than not they took away more people than they dropped off. The colonial population was becoming increasingly uncomfortable, and a lot of bribes changed hands to transport people away. 
- 3E 290-305 - Rebels begin to re-emerge, consisting of the old Esri nobility, Imperial defectors, and others who spot a power vacuum and hence opportunity. Much of the rebellion is conducted as hit and run raids by Esri shipmasters, who know the coves and waterways, and have fast, manoeuvrable ships. The Imperial garrison is able to execute some but not all of these rebels.
- 3E 305 - There is a great deal of civil unrest. Several outlying islands have been lost to what the Imperials still call "pirate clans". A legion officer, Corus Gavinius, strikes a deal with the captive Princess Mayusri: if he seizes control of the legion and helps her recover the royal family's power, she will name him the head of a new noble clan and grant him a seat on the reformed Black Council. 
- 3E 306 - After quietly gathering support among the garrison, Corus Gavinius strikes, and seizes control from the Imperial loyalists after a bloody struggle. The priesthood declares its support of the royal family, and Mayusri regains control of Black Harbour.
- 3E 307 - The last rebels are brought into line through force or negotiation, and the Black Council is reformed, although the royal family holds notably less power than it did before the occupation.
## People Of Interest
The inhabitants of Esroniet are known as the [[esri|Esri]].
### Historical
- Prince **Bashomon dir-Esroniet** (deceased) - ruling sovereign at the time of the imperial conquest
- Princess **Mayusri dir-Esroniet** (deceased) - Bashomon's heir, Imperial captive during the occupation, held in Fort Tigermoth, rumored to have had an affair with Uriel V, definitely had some kind of relationship with Corus Gavinius
- **Corus Gavinius dir-Corus** (deceased) - The mutinous officer at Fort Tigermoth who seized power after the withdrawal of the tattered remains of the Expeditionary Force. Chief architect of the reformed Black Council, which much more closely resembles the Elder Council or the Cyrodiilic county system than its previous incarnations. His friendship/relationship with Mayusri dir-Esroniet is credited both with the royal family being able to maintain some form of power in the new order, and with his understanding of the Esri way, which he learned from her, and which allowed him to successfully insinuate himself into that new order - and keep himself there until his death decades later. 
- Emperor **Uriel Septim V** (deceased) - the Emperor who lead the invasion force that conquered Esroniet. Divisive historical figure.
### Royal Family
- Princess **Kiann dir-Esroniet** (current Prince(ss)) - cautious, cowed by the Black Council, doesn't want to rock the boat. 
- Lady **Tasri dir-Kiann** - Kiann's daughter - ambitious, wants to take back power for the royal family
- Lord **Kiet dir-Kiann** - Kiann's son - careful, kind-hearted, nurturing, in favour of policies that help the poor, chief carer for Kiann when she's sick
### Clan Leaders / Black Councilors
Some clan leaders are based in Black Harbor, some live almost entirely on their ships. Gaining clan status is dependent on your head being able to get a seat on the council, which you can basically do by being powerful enough that the existing councilors have to acknowledge your right to be there.  
  
Beyond the pirate clan leaders, the two serving head priests of Kina and Zenir also have a position on the council, as does the Prince.  
  
Where before the Prince was considered the head of the council, with the council existing to advise them, the prince is now only one of many. That the Prince retained a seat on the council at all is largely due to the influence of the priesthood, to whom the royal family remains an important embodiment of Esroniet itself.

- **Kannika dir-Kannika** (head of a clan, councillor)
- **Ralianus Gavinius dir-Ralianus** (head of the most powerful clan, the one in control of Fort Tigermoth and the western island, descendant of Corus Gavinius)
- **Rikara dir-Rikara** (head of a clan, councillor)
- **Zaraya dir-Zaraya** (head of a clan, councillor, Tamar's mother, ill)
- **Ranna dir-Zenir** (head priestess of Zenir, councillor)
- **Kadek dir-Kina** (head priest of Kina, councillor)
- **Kiann dir-Esroniet** (Princess of Esroniet, councillor)
