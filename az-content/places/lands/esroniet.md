Esroniet was Conquered by Emperor Uriel V in 3E284. [^1] The island nation may have been yielded peacefully by Prince Bashomon. Black Harbor is a strategically critical settlement on the island and may also be the largest. When it was conquered in 3E282, the Empire immediately commenced renovations. [^2] The historical leader of Esroniet may have been a "Prince" since the named individual who surrendered the nation to the Empire was called Prince Bashomon. [^3] Natural or otherwise, Esroniet is known to weather bad storms and/or hurricanes. [^4]

> Since Esroniet was used as the launch site for the invasion of Akavir, Black Harbor would likely have been renovated to provide enough space to make very large transport ships including drydocks. This could potentially lead to houses there being built on stilts along with the construction of drainage canals and storm walls as a design feature.

With the disaster at Ionith, the Empire only maintained a weak control of Esroniet which, being the furthest island from Tamriel, quickly faltered and failed. This led to the rise of the [[padomaic-pirates|Padomaic "Black" Pirates]] to power in Black Harbor.

The indigenous population is primarily human and are descended from a combination of human refugees of Akavir with some mixture with the ancient nedes from Morrowind (i.e. "Men-of-Morrowind").
