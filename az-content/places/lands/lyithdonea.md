## Origins
Although it is believed to be a mostly false tale, [[house-azura|House Azura]] legend states that [[azura|Azura]] herself raised the isles out of the ocean and populated them with unique life. In actuality, no amount of Azuraâ€™s power would have allowed her to change anything to such a great extent on Nirn. Read more in [[the-translation|The Translation]]. The Khajiit would say "this is just like Azurah, taking credit for her littermate Nirni's beauty."

> [[azura|Azura]] would also have access to creatia. Perhaps that is what she used to create Lyithdonea. If there's any truth to the legend.
