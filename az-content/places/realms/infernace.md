Home of the flame atronachs, Infernace exists as a collective extension of the atronachs themselves. [^1] It is described as being filled with magma, fumaroles, and even more magma. [^2]

By nature of not having a direct Prince presiding over it, doors to Oblivion are often opened to collective realms like Infernace as a starting point from Mundus as its boundaries are easier to pierce.

The elemental planes are constantly shifting, disappearing, reappearing due to the fact that they are based on influxes (flows, rivers, streams) of [[creatia|creatia]] from Aetherius. They are magical and dangerous to outsiders. When an elemental plane fades out, the Atronachs must migrate to a new location. This makes for a very dynamic environment.
