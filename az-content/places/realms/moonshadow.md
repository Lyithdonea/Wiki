Azura's realm is described as a twilight island of shades and half-thoughts filled with flowers, waterfalls, majestic trees, a city of silver, and a blinding beauty which blurs vision. [^1] [^2] A jade moon fills the sky and portions of the  landscape is jagged. [^3] The weather may involve frequent rainfall and storms which cause the surrounding sea to become described as "furious". [^2] [^3] Visitors to the realm have historically come mainly from the Dunmer of eastern Morrowind and the catfolk of Elsweyr, whose people both hold a great affection for the mother of immanence, though by separate roads. [^1]

Like other realms of Oblivion, it is likely that Azura harnessed the energy of [[creatia|creatia]] to form Moonshadow within the void. [^4]

> [!Musings]
> Azura's realm may be represented in two phases: Dusk and Dawn. There is no day and night cycle on the island; just a perpetual Twilight. These two regions may have different topography (e.g. jagged landscape in Dusk) as well as distinct flora and fauna.
## Twilight Star
Azura's Star, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of the Steed when Azura's powers over dawn and dusk allow her to lift the veil of Oblivion for mortal eyes to behold her realm. [^5]
