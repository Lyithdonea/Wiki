> [[azura|Azura]] is the Lord of Moonshadow, whose sphere is dusk and dawn, the magic in-between realms of twilight.

Could her realm perhaps be represented in two phases as well. There is not day and night there. Only Twilight. Indefinitely.

Idea for an explanation of Azura’s Star: Azura’s Star is not a star at all, which are really just holes to Aetherius. Remember that when you look into the night sky you gaze into oblivion. However, under normal circumstances, one cannot actually see anything in oblivion other than a darkness devoid of light. This is due to the fact that the planes of oblivion lie not within our mortal boundaries and therefore are not visible to our mortal eyes. However, the Twilight hours are Azura’s sphere and therefore she is able to grant a glimpse of her realm to us during those times. This is the reason for her star appearing during the hours of dawn and dusk. ([The Anticipations](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/anticipations))

Azura’s realm is called Moonshadow because it lies in the shadow of the moons, Jone and Jode. Azura is the Rim of All Holes. She knows the First Secret and therefore control travel through the lunar lattice. The hole she is the rim of is the lattice. Take this quote from the TIL Lore Forum:  

> Azura can bypass the lattice, because she is the break in the lattice - the rim of all holes.

> “'They were on a jagged island in a furious sea beneath a sky half-filled with a jade moon.' Based on Sul's trajectory, this is likely Azura's realm." p.256 from The Infernal City.

> Azura, Lord of Dusk and Dawn, maintains the domain of Moonshadow, a twilight country of shades and half-thoughts. Visitors to this isle have historically come mainly from the Dunmer of eastern Morrowind and the catfolk of Elsweyr, whose people both hold a great affection for the mother of immanence, though by separate roads. At the time of this writing, regular gateways to Moonshadow have been inaccessible for the last several years. Whether this has to do with the unlawful incidents at Hogithum Hall in the Capital City or mere whim of Azura herself, no one can say. Of course, Azura’s most famous acts of recent times is the Incarnation of the Nerevarine, a subject that while far beyond the scope of this pamphlet has been felt to the present day.
