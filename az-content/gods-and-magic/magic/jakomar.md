Jakomar is a dead Ehlnofey whose body is believed to lie below [[lyithdonea|Lyithdonea]] and be the source of the unique sunstone mineral which can be found there. Although everything surrounding Jakomar is wreathed in myth, he is thought to have resembled an enormous drake which absorbed and radiated sunlight. [^1] Depictions of The Sundrake are rare, but the [[maormer|Maormer]] who lived in Lyithdonea appear to have worshipped it in some capacity.
