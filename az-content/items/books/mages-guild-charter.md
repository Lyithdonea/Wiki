## I. Purpose  
  
The Guild of Mages provides benefits to scholars of magic and established laws regarding the proper use of magic. The Guild is dedicated to the collection, preservation, and distribution of magical knowledge with an emphasis on ensuring that all citizens of Tamriel benefit from this knowledge. Specifically, the Guildhall in the Azurian Isles was established primarily to research and possibly channel the strong daedric magicka coursing through the archipelago. Secondarily, the hall was established as an elite campus for training members in the Schools of Magicka.  
  
## II. Authority  
  
The Guild of Mages was established on Summerset Isle in the year 230 of the Second Era by Vanus Galerion and Rilis XII. It was later confirmed by the "Guilds Act" of Potentate Versidue-Shaie. Under Magnate Fedrose of House Azura, the Guild of Mages was granted charter in Lyithdonea.  
  
## III. Rules and Procedures  
  
Crimes against fellow members of the Guild are treated with the harshest discipline. Whether a member may regain their status in the Guild is determined by the Arch-Mage.  
  
## IV. Membership Requirements  
  
The Guild of Mages only accepts candidates of keen intelligence and dominant will. Candidates must exhibit mastery in the great schools of magic: Destruction, Alteration, Illusion, and Mysticism. Candidates must also display practical knowledge of enchantments and alchemical processes.  
  
## V. Applications for Membership  
  
Candidates must present themselves to the Steward of the Guild Hall for examination and approval.  
  
## ATTACHMENT A: Mages Guild Chapter in Lyithdonea, Non-Imperial Territory of House Azura  
  
The Guild’s single Lyithdonean Chapterhouse was established on the isle of Dor Dalla. The island’s deed was purchased from House Azura on 23 Sun’s Height, 712 2E. The Right of Architecture was granted the same year, which preserved Imperial construction influence on the isle to the present day.
