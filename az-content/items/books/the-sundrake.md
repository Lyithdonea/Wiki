Why does Sunstone appear so far from the sun?

In times of old, beings of strange form and appearance -- made by the gods -- roamed the land. One such creature was an old sea drake, older than all the others, older even than the sea in which it swam. During the day, its scales absorbed the sun's radiance and glowed with an auric brilliance.

It was made of metal and yet flesh. Lines made of sunstone traced each scale like a fisherman's net; running throughout the creature's body like our veins, delivering sunlight where it is needed. The lines held fast, never relinquishing a drop while their host was whole.

Where blood flows within us, sunlight flowed. Its heart, charged with the task of sending that sunlight to the rest of its body, worked like the engine of an airship. Like this it flew, not with the flapping of wings; it swam from air to sea and back again like it scarcely noticed the difference.

But Nirn is a jealous place, filled with jealous things.

Favored with great strength and intellect, they knew power far beyond that of mer and men; but their power made them proud, and at length they sought to challenge the gods.

"The birds may fly but may not breathe water, for that is their bargain." Cried the beings of the sky.

"The fish may swim but may not breathe air, for that is their bargain." Replied the beings of the sea.

"The drake cannot have both." They demanded in unison.

Hearing this, the gods were angered and struck down their blessed children, and binding their souls and flesh, they stole their freedom for all eternity.

But their wrath was so great, they struck down all their children; so too was the innocent drake bound beneath the dirt. Its scales scorching the ground as they broke away, pouring sunlight into the stone.

If you hold sunstone up to the sun, on a completely overcast day, you may still hear the old drake gently weeping.
