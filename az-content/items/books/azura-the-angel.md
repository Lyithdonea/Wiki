Queen of the Night Sky, Mother of the Rose. You know her, but have you seen her? Depictions of her in Tamriel are fairly consistent, a woman, bare breasted, holding out a moon and a star. But our Lady of Twilight is one of the daedra, the lords of misrule, misrepresentation, and mystique. Many wrongly believe that the daedra they see carved into their elder’s mantelpieces are the only forms that exist. The figures we mortals are familiar with are merely the facade the daedra most often choose to manifest themselves in. In truth the daedra have no ‘true’ form. They are et’Ada and only maintain tangible substance due to their ineffable whim. Nevertheless, [[azura|Azura]] most often appears as the arm-stretched woman.

Some rare sculptures of Azura portray her as the woman, but winged like the aetheric angels of legends. Many interpret those pieces to merely depict her saintly aspect. Thus the tapestries which I have seen show her clad in sapphire and winged with white feathers. However, those of her Sacred House know that in actuality this is her most terrible embodiment. Similar to Mehrunes Dagon in his attack on the Mourning Hold, this is Azura’s war-form. The recorded times in our history when she has assumed it are few, but the results are inarguably devastating.

It has been centuries since Azura last assumed her war-form. And we have very little factual evidence to discern her character when she does. But, most assuredly, the refulgent illustrations of her winged form are false. Lord Azura is known for guiding her subjects through dreams and by sending her Winged Twilights as messengers. However, in times of damning struggle, Azura may reveal herself as the winged, clawed, and chimeric demon that brings her own tidings, through blood.
