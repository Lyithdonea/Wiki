## Legend of the Daybreaker  
Compiled By Reldas Othremu  
  
Lady Azura passed over the sea-like-turquoise when it was devoid of territories. There in the midst of the lonely emptiness swam a school of Teal Water Snakes. They frolicked in the warm water, caring not for the naught about them. Azura was troubled by the apathy of the water snakes, saying: "worship is half of life; indifference is half of death." With that she took hold of the snakes in her shadow-solid grasp and twisted them until they cried out in anguish, saying: "but the halves which are neither worship nor indifference hate the other!" And so Azura, thinking that the snakes had insulted her knowledge of duality, bound them to a tuft of swordgrass, forever to languish in the soil like roots. When Azura began to form the holy isles, the rude water snakes were the first to take root in the wet earth.  
  
To this day the water snakes rise up every morning, issuing renewed effort to free themselves from their earthy prison, but failing each attempt. In final rebellion, it is said that the snakes will stick a mocking blue tongue at the Mother of the Night Sky.
