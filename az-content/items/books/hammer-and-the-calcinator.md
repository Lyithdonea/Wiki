Advanced Applications of Alchemical Principles in Metallurgy  
by Maester Jercel Merard  
## Chapter One: Galvannization  
Didn't your guild magister teach you that when Ur-Tower glass is in contact with dissimilar materials, the high mageopotential differential causes the glass to act as an anode while the other material (most often a high quality steel forged with ebony equipment) will act as a sithode. As any student of alchemy is aware, daedron migration between two materials is most notable in metals and metalloids - such as raw ebony - due to their relative ease for conductivity (See "Treatise on Wizard's Staff Creation" for more information on the superiority of metals in magical channeling capability). In the case of the incredibly unstable green glass of Morrowind, such contact (e.g. in the assembly of armor) generates a strong current of daedrons from the glass into the metal in a process known as sithode protection. The resulting enhanced steel allows such armaments to be forged in much thinner sections. Theoretically, the shards of glass built into the armor would eventually fuse into the metal, disappearing entirely. But their high daedron density relative to most metals would put any noticeable decay several thousand years beyond the time of first contact.
