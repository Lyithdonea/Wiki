description: A poem dedicated to the Daedric Princes
---
Though man and mer knew sin  
since time began,  
The Daedric Princes  
watch each mer and man  
Azura lights the day  
from dawn to dusk  
Hermaeus Mora  
calls up memories  
Hircine's Wild Hunt  
tracks blood and scent and musk  
Boethiah  
pursues conspiracies  
Foul Malacath  
remembers every curse  
Mehrunes Dagon  
knows destruction's wrath  
Mad Sheogorath  
hums a nonsense verse  
Stern Jyggalag  
sets order on its path  
Dark Molag Bal  
takes blood and souls as wealth  
Vaermina lives  
in worlds that dreamers see  
Though none can match  
unseen Norturnal's stealth  
Or hedonistic  
Sanguine's revelry  
For every troubled soul  
that must aspire,  
A Daedric Prince  
can grant each dark desire
