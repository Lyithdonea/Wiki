## Introduction  
Daedra hail from the hellish plane of Oblivion. They are most often encountered in Tamriel as a result of sorcerous summoning. Something most common folk have little experience with. But the astute adventurer will arm themselves with the knowledge necessary for defeating these otherworldly foes. This comprehensive series of guides, compiled by a veteran Daedra-slayer, will provide the necessary tips and secrets for defeating the most common types of daedra.  
## Volume I
### Prologue  
This first guide will deal with three of the most frequently encountered daedra. These daedra are the minions of Mehrunes Dagon: the pesky Scamp, the saurian Clannfear, and the noble yet deadly Dremora.  
### Scamp
The neophyte adventurer will undoubtedly encounter this agile creature in a dungeon romp or as the hostile summon of a novice conjurer. Although the proficient warrior could simply slay this beast with the flick of a wrist, we will assume that the fighter is green as a raw sheet of volcanic glass. Although some particular strains of Scamp are capable of casting magical bursts (such as the Burning Scamp or Ducal Scamps), magical skill is particularly infrequent among them. I have found that all Scamps tend to follow the same method of attack, the charge followed by mindlessly beating on the armor of the besieged. Generally, there is time to consider many different battle plans as the Scamp rushes toward the combatant. However, through my early years of fighting these daedra I developed the most efficient technique. As the charging Scamp is nearly close enough to flay flesh, roll or step to the side and return a back-handed slash towards the Daedroth’s backside. This tactic will almost invariably work, leaving the Scamp wounded before the scuffle has even begun. Now that the Scamp is vulnerable, traditional blocking / parrying / thrusting rules apply. If the fighter is a dexterous marksman or mage, melee combat can easily be avoided by simply outrunning the beast and sending projectiles its way.  
### Clannfear
The Clannfear is a strange creation of Dagon which resembles a creature of our own plane more than a daedra. However, upon slaying a Clannfear and inspecting its ephemeral remains, it becomes quite clear they do not originate from Nirn. Clannfear are infrequently summoned by sorcerers simply because they have the beastly habit of nipping at their masters out of boredom. This tendency may be mundane in the Deadlands, but it can be quite harmful to fleshy mortals. Therefore these daedra are more often encountered as solitary guardians of daedric ruins or shrines.  
  
Skirmishes with Clannfear are often initiated by the creature itself. I have found them to be frustratingly sneaky s’wits. Take care when fighting Clannfears with swords or spears as their scaly hide is quite resistant to piercing attacks. Clannfear do however possess a weakness. After slaying a Clannfear, and examining its corpse, I discovered them to be surprisingly lightweight. It would seem that their bone-structure resembles the cliffracers of Vvardenfell Island, which would attribute to their light-footedness. This anatomical aspect can be exploited while fighting the beast. If the fighter has some skill in blunt weapons, a warhammer or even a small mace have proven to be exceptionally deadly when directed at a Clannfear. The intense blows from these weapons will quickly crush the bones of the Daedroth, rendering it helpless.  
  
Ordindary Clannfear have no magical abilities to speak of and so require no complex strategy to banish.  
### Dremora
Dremora are one of the most complex daedra I have ever encountered throughout my questing days. Because so much has already been documented regarding their peculiar behavior and clan mentality, this guide will keep to the not-so-simple task of besting a Dremora in combat.  
  
Caution. Caution is required when advancing on a Dremora. Oftentimes they will wait until the last moment to attack their enemy, luring with curiosity. Although some friendly (or at least tolerant Dremora) have been recorded, mainly within the Tribunal Temple, most are hostile and will guard their charge to the death of their corporeal manifestations.  
  
Defeating a Dremora is a simple but deadly accomplishment. They may be approached much in the same way you would assault any man or mer. Their fighting style varies little from the mortal races. Perhaps this is meant to surprise the unwary. Take care though, as they tend to cast a Shield around themselves to stem off physical bludgeoning. Scrolls or spells of Dispel can remove this effect if the traveler can afford them. On the other hand, prudence is advised when casting spells against the daedra as their angular, unnatural armor seems to inherently reflect some spells back at the caster.  
  
Little additional guidance can be given other than to brush up on your weapon or archaic skill of choice and wear appropriate armor for the encounter. Also remember that Dremora usually attack with powerful weapons which lack enchantment, but most often they do not carry a shield. Exploit this when possible by remaining always on the offensive.
## Volume II
### Prologue  
This guide lists some of the random daedra which may be encountered in daedric ruins or shrines. And save one, they may also be fought as the summons of proficient conjurers.  
### Hunger
Boethiah’s sphere is treachery and deceit, crippling governments seemingly for pleasure. It follows that a servant of Boethiah would share this attitude of enfeebling. Here is my word of advice for those who stumble upon a Hunger Daedra; turn the other direction. Little good comes from slaying a hunger unless you are under contract to eradicate the beast. They have little of value recoverable from their physical bodies and the trouble they cause is hardly worth the effort.  
  
I say all this primarily because of the Hunger’s ability to disintegrate armor through their destructive magic and also their paralyzing touch. Belying its name, the Hunger has great reserves of magicka and will refrain from attacking at close range even if forced. Instead it will madly throw Daedric magic to obliterate your armor. Unless the adventurer has deep pockets indeed for repairing their equipment, they will want to bring wards of Spell Absorption or Reflection to repel the Hunger’s persistent volleys.  
The safest way for a warrior to defeat a Hunger is from a distance, dodging magical bolts and casting projectiles of their own after the daedroth. If marksmanship or magic is not your strongest asset, then melee combat may be inevitable. In the event that close combat must be commenced against a Hunger, take this advice. Prior to meeting the creature, remove your armor since the daedroth will not attack you until it is finished casting bolts, which quite often lasts until the end of the combat. This is one of the very few instances where removal of the armor is recommended, and it should only be practiced if no other daedra or creatures are within range of the fight. Once close enough to strike the Hunger, be careful to avoid its spiny extrusions. Sometimes, ancient Hungers have poisoned spines which have caused the death of many-an-adventurer.  
### Ogrim
The burly Ogrim could almost rightfully be mistaken for goblin-kin. The Daedric Prince Malacath shaped the Ogrims and they bear a familiar resemblance to the goblins and orcs of Tamriel. This fact is not as strange as it may seem initially, since Malacath is the patron lord of the Orcs.  
  
Enough narration however, let us speak of fighting an Ogrim. Since their intelligence is as wanting as a Hunger’s stomach, the Ogrim’s immense size is the largest obstacle to overcome here. Similar to the Hunger, the Ogrim can simply be defeated from a distance using projectiles; however its scaly hide can deflect many of the arrows. Melee with an Ogrim is equally difficult, Agility and accuracy are necessary. The Ogrim slowly lumbers about, so the best tactic to use against them is to dart in and out avoiding its crushing arms. If one is accurate enough to avoid the roll of its stomach, the legs are a vulnerable area to attack.  
  
A final caution is to evade being smothered by the beast’s girth against a wall. The daedroth favors this ploy, as it is then free to club the trapped mortal to death.  
### Spider Daedra
Many adventurers have never before encountered a Spider Daedra. One of the reasons for their rarity is the fact that they make poor summons, as they are nearly impossible to control; often mutilating their conjurer.  
  
Spider Daedra are the spawn of Mephala and their irrationality must initiate from her inexplicable whims. If forced into combat with a Spider Daedroth, there are two possible scenarios which I have found to be most effective. First, if you can distract the daedroth with something like a summoning or enemy (they often attack their own), then you will be free to attack them from behind as they seem to lack very wide attention spans. Or, if you can proficiently handle a shield, then it can help deflect the majority of the Spider Daedroth’s wildl blows. Stay on the defensive until a weak spot reveals itself or the Daedroth becomes distracted by another bystander.
## Volume III
### Prologue
This guide details the most capable methods for felling the atronachs of Oblivion. There are many varying types of Atronachs, this guide will discuss the three most prevalent varieties. The method of defeating Atronachs varies only slightly, mainly due to differing elemental affiliations, so pay close attention. Also, do not confuse Atronachs with simple golems which are magical or mechanical in nature, not Daedric.  
### Flame Atronach
Flame Atronachs are often encountered in subterranean lava caverns where they brood on gods know what. Even if startled, tussling with a Flame Atronach can be a hassle. The health-conscious battler must be carefully aware not to make bodily contact with the daedroth. A Flame Atronach’s surface is composed of a thick, nearly magmatic fluid, contained by the creature’s life essence. Touching their flesh will result in severe burning; In fact, even getting too close to the Atronach can be wounding, as they tend to emanate random sprays of flame. Unless the adventurer cares little for comeliness, it is highly recommended that the attacker wear a full set of armor, especially covering the entire face.  
  
The physical dangers of battling a Flame Atronach are only the beginning of the hardships. This Daedroth should only be tackled by those of strong arm and firm resilience. They are not any easy foe. Before entering battle with a Flame Atronach, the clever fighter will be sure to bring along a trinket of Spell Absorption, or something which strongly resists elemental fire. Especially in tight quarters it is nearly impossible to dodge an atronach’s fireball. Due to the unstable condition of these Daedra, their elemental projections explode on impact with any surface. Therefore, if you stand in front of a wall, regardless whether you are agile enough to dodge the flame bolt; it will explode behind you and have an immensely detrimental effect on your peace of mind.  
  
Flame Atronachs tend to continue blasting magicka until their reserves are depleted, then resort to melee. One simple preparatory tactic which I have employed against Atronachs is to cast a strong spell or read an enchanted scroll of Spell Absorption right before the Atronach begins unleashing its volley. For the duration of the spell the combatant is free to choose his own approach. A battlemage may choose to send magicka back at the daedra (obviously Frost spells are the most potent) or a warrior could begin hacking it. However, the accurate Marksman has an advantage here. If an arrow is released directly into the path of the flame bolt, then the orb will ignite prematurely leaving the bowman unharmed.  
  
Whichever method is chosen and if the daedra survives up to this point, it will soon run out of magicka and will charge. If this occurs, the principles laid out in the first paragraph apply regarding touching the Atronach. Utmost caution is proposed at this point, but felling the beast is only a matter of attacking it.  
### Frost Atronach
So you wish to learn how to defeat a Frost Atronach… cleanly and efficiently. Be wary, this cold-hearted Daedra will approach your death in the same manner. Come armed with fireballs if you will, only be cautious. As do all Atronachs, the icy variety come equipped with the ability to Reflect spells back at the caster.  
  
Similar to a Flame Atronach, a Frost Atronach’s outer surface can be harmful to the combatant. However, much less caution is required in this encounter than the former, at least regarding physical contact. Wearing thick gloves and a full helm to protect against the daedra’s icy breath will help protect against a hellish frostbite.  
  
Allow me to copy the paragraph from above to illustrate defending against the icy bursts which the Frost Atronachs unleash: "The physical dangers of battling a \[Frost\] Atronach are only the beginning of the hardships. This Daedroth should only be tackled by those of strong arm and firm resilience. They are not any easy foe. Before entering battle with a \[Frost\] Atronach, the clever fighter will be sure to bring along a trinket of Spell Absorption, or something which strongly resists elemental \[frost\]. Especially in tight quarters it is nearly impossible to dodge an atronach’s \[frostball\]. Due to the unstable condition of these Daedra, their elemental projections explode on impact with any surface. Therefore, if you stand in front of a wall, regardless whether you are agile enough to dodge the \[frost\]bolt; it will explode behind you and have an immensely detrimental effect on your peace of mind.  
  
\[Frost\] Atronachs tend to continue blasting magicka until their reserves are depleted, then resort to melee. One simple preparatory tactic which I have employed against Atronachs is to cast a strong spell or read an enchanted scroll of Spell Absorption right before the Atronach begins unleashing its volley. For the duration of the spell the combatant is free to choose his own approach. A battlemage may choose to send magicka back at the daedra (obviously \[Flame\]spells are the most potent) or a warrior could begin hacking it. However, the accurate Marksman has an advantage here. If an arrow is released directly into the path of the \[frost\]bolt, then the orb will ignite prematurely leaving the bowman unharmed."  
  
Now pay careful attention here because melee with a Frost Atronach is severely different than battling a Flame Atronach. Frost Atronachs are deceptive daedra and seek to best the daedra-slayer by upsetting their balance through unanticipated attacks. The Atronach may try to lure the attacker in closer by attacking with its hands at first. However, once the fighter is within range, I have found that they take great delight in swiftly extending a frosty icicle sword through the surprised combatant’s midsection. Be ever alert when close enough to the daedra for this to occur. If timed correctly the icicle can be dodged and then severed, injuring the Atronach.  
### Storm Atronach
Have you ever fought a floating, orbiting body of rock? No? Then you have never encountered a Storm Atronach. In the same manner as the preceding Atronachs, the Storm variety will also conjure bolts of magicka to destroy their attackers. The tactics for avoiding their bolts of lightning remain the same as before, just be sure to leave your wet clothes behind before getting struck by a shockbloom. I will not repeat myself once again so reread the previous paragraphs to obtain the knowledge you require.  
  
Once again however, melee combat with a Storm Atronach is not so simple. The warrior is advised to be either: extremely agile, equipped and proficient with a shield, arrayed in heavy armor, or best of all to possess all of these skills. The Storm Atronach is inherently a Daedric tempest spirit; the windy Daedra will gather rock and debris to take form in the mundus. The danger when facing a Storm Atronach is that it has complete control over every last orbiting pebble. Generally the daedra will take on a roughly humanoid form and bash the contestant with large boulder-hands. However in order to distract or injure, the Atronach will also send smaller rocks flying towards the adventurer. This is when armor and dodging become useful. The key to defeating a Storm Atronach is to club at it hard enough to knock it’s forming rocks away from the daedra’s core. This will render it weak enough to banish.
## Volume IV
### Prologue
This guide deals with three of the most powerful daedra which are commonly summoned or bound: The crocodilian Daedroth, the Winged Twilight - messenger of Azura, and the Golden Saint - servant of the Mad God.  
### Daedroth
I have found this beast a confusing one to encounter. Rather than mauling an opponent with its razor-sharp claws and crushing them under the strength of its mighty arms, the Daedroth will, quite adeptly, cast powerful destructive magic. To learn the full tactic of averting ranged explosive spells refer to the third volume in this guide. If you are still breathing when the dark kin has cast every last ounce of his magicka at you, you must then survive the deadly claws and muscles I mentioned before.  
  
In close combat with a Daedroth the adventurer must be wary of the Daedroth’s long neck which allows the monster to easily snap its jaws in many directions. If you are successful in avoiding the Daedroth’s flailing attempts to dismember you then go for the torso, destroy the beast’s heart; cut its chest cavity apart. Daedroths have been known to continue desperately fighting even after losing limbs; including their head.  
### Winged Twilight
Watch your head, or you may lose it to Azura’s loyal messengers. Though, what exactly they are attempting to communicate to us mortals still escapes me. Nearly every Winged Twilight I have ever encountered wanted nothing more than my blood covering its talons.  
  
Confronting one of these harpies from hell can be challenging to say the least. In regards to what gear to pack (as if one can plan for a Winged Twilight attack) I would suggest a spear, bow, or anything that can reach them. These daedra tend to gather in small groups and stay to the high ground. By screeching and flapping their wings they attempt to distract the prey. Then when you least expect it, your intestines have become their new nesting.  
  
If you brought some sort of far-reaching weapon, get it out now. Make sure to keep your back against a wall, the Winged Twilights are wary of a caged rat. Many times these daedra will resort to flying in a flurry around their victim, confusing them by their apparent number, striking at random. Do not be fooled, hit at them when they are clearly visible, remain guarded when they are not. Their skin is thin and their vitals densely packed. One clean strike to the chest can kill one.  
### Golden Saint
The Golden Saints I have encountered in my travels are adept fighters. They wield anything from a katana to a longspear, and both expertly. Although these daedra are found infrequently, they often signal the presence of great treasure. Though the "golden" in their name actually refers to their skin which takes on a suitably aurealic sheen; some mistake it to refer to their quarries which can be quite valuable.  
  
Felling a Golden Saint is one of the most difficult battles you will face. They are by far the most powerful daedra I have included in this guide. The saints often use shields in fights and will deflect a great number of blows against them. You may think that you could simply attack with magic, but this would be an unwise decision. Golden Saints reflect a great portion of offensive spells and they will dispel any that do get through. This tendency nearly nullifies a caster’s actions against them.  
  
In short summary: Warriors must confront them head on and hope for the best. Archers can hold back, but the Daedra cannot be held back forever. Thieves will have no luck sneaking up on a Golden Saint; their senses are supernatural to say the least. A mage - is nix fodder.
## Appendix A
### Introduction  
When the possibility of confronting multiple types of daedra exists in a certain situation, obviously one cannot simply prepare for a certain kind. This Appendix will outline the weaponry, armor, and wards and other equipment suggested for daedra-slaying ventures.
### Weaponry
Due to the oblivion matter which is the make of every daedroth, ordinary weapons such as steel, iron, or chitin will simply have no effect on them. If the absent-minded daedra-slayer attempts to utilize such mundane weapons against a daedroth, the ineffectiveness of them will soon become apparent. Upon each swing, the blade will simply blur against the daedroth’s hide, thrusting right through. The blade will be blurred between oblivion and the mundus, unable to decide what it is striking. As a teacher and warrior, I strongly advice against such foolhardy measures since they tend to confuse the wielder as much as the blade. This leaves the combatant inextricably susceptible to attacks from the daedroth who is none the poorer for the failed attack.  
  
In battle against daedra, it is henceforth necessary to bear arms of refined temperament. This class of weapons includes, but is not constrained to: silver, ebony, glass, enchanted, orcish, and adamantium. Weapons of these types are able to keenly strike daedra, sending them back to Oblivion.  
  
One weapon type which merits special attention here are the numerous Daedric weapons found in Tamriel. Throughout my exploits, I have found that many of the simpler-minded daedra have a strange aversion to daedric weapons. However, some more intelligent daedra such as the Golden Saints and Dremora utilize the weapons themselves. I have concluded simply that this inbred fear stems from the knowledge that daedric souls are trapped within the weapons. Perhaps the daedra can hear their brethren’s tormented cries issuing from the weapons, repelling them from the possibility of sharing their fate. The few daedra who carry the weapons may do so out of shear cruelty to the lesser souls trapped within their weapons. But, having never consulted one of them on the subject, I speak only out of speculation.  
### Armor
There is little to say regarding armor to defend against the daedra’s attacks. As in most combat situations, to each his own. Whatever the fighter is most comfortable wearing, let them bring that to battle. Though it should be noted that some elemental Daedra strongly merit the use of armored masks.  
### Equipment
Many daedra are adept spell-casters and if the daedra-slayer is unprepared for their magical attacks they will soon find themselves to be colder than Molag Bal’s heart or crisper than a Deadlands corpse, and quite dead. The exact spell types cast by various daedra is detailed better in the previous volumes of this series. However, I strongly suggest carrying enchanted wards into battle against the dark kin. Some may choose to bring items with Reflect spells invoked upon them; however, this often proves redundant because many daedra are capable of reflecting the spell back at the caster. I have found that the most enduring protection against daedric magic is an enchantment of Spell Absorption. With this special incantation upon themselves, the warrior will be able to avoid spells and replenish their own magicka reserves if needs be.  
  
Many adventurers cannot afford the pricey enchantments peddled by mages, therefore I offer an alternative. Bring potions and/or scrolls of Restore Health, along with you to heal yourself if you are unfortunate enough to be caught in a magical blast.  
  
This suggestion has not been comprehensive, but I entreat the reader to heed my suggestions and bring along protection against the maelstrom daedra will unleash to avoid being sent back to their masters with their tails between their scaly legs.
