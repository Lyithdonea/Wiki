The [[ouag-tong|Ouag Tong]], roughly translated as the “Waterers Guild”, has its origins shrouded in the mists of time. While I’m sure that members of the guild are privy to deeper historical facts, outsiders such as I are denied access to their records and my attempts at contacting the Doyen (or headmaster) of the guild have proved unsuccessful. One commonly held theory is that the Tong was originally a [[maormer|Maormer]] cult which was dissolved during the Hlamola Encounter and later grew to prominence again under [[chimer|Chimer]] leadership. The current roster is largely composed of south islander Chimer (known locally as Ouamer). The Ouag Tong nurtures peaceful relations with the Ouamer but has no known ties to [[house-azura|House Azura]]. The one ignores the other.

From the few meetings I have had with guild members, it would seem that they recognize but do not worship any of the typical deities of Tamriel. Instead they appear to be more animistic, with several minor deities (mostly elemental in nature). They do have a central “God” whom they refer to as Grandfather Ocean. He is the deity of which I have the most knowledge.

Grandfather Ocean is described in [[the-nautican|The Nautican]] (a beginner’s pamphlet) as: “…the guardian of time’s spoils, moving currents over the sand skin.” From this passage and other information I have gleaned, I have formed my own hypothesis on the nature of Grandfather Ocean. If it is indeed true that the Ouag Tong began as a Maormer association, then perhaps the current guild borrows from that cult’s pantheon. I believe that Grandfather Ocean may be a distant version of Akatosh altered to fit within the guild’s mythos. If you wade through all the metaphors about Grandfather Ocean being associated with currents and moving sand, then he can be seen as wielding dominion over time. And the main hall of their headquarters boasts a large mural of a serpentine creature contorted in a wave-like pattern over an ocean blue field which further bolsters my hypothesis. ^063336
