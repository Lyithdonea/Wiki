## Introduction  
Daedra hail from the hellish plane of Oblivion. They are most often encountered in Tamriel as a result of sorcerous summoning. Something most common folk have little experience with. But the astute adventurer will arm themselves with the knowledge necessary for defeating these otherworldly foes. This comprehensive series of guides, compiled by a veteran Daedra-slayer, will provide the necessary tips and secrets for defeating the most common types of daedra.  
## Prologue  
This guide deals with three of the most powerful daedra which are commonly summoned or bound: The crocodilian Daedroth, the Winged Twilight - messenger of Azura, and the Golden Saint - servant of the Mad God.  
## Daedroth
I have found this beast a confusing one to encounter. Rather than mauling an opponent with its razor-sharp claws and crushing them under the strength of its mighty arms, the Daedroth will, quite adeptly, cast powerful destructive magic. To learn the full tactic of averting ranged explosive spells refer to the third volume in this guide. If you are still breathing when the dark kin has cast every last ounce of his magicka at you, you must then survive the deadly claws and muscles I mentioned before.  
  
In close combat with a Daedroth the adventurer must be wary of the Daedroth’s long neck which allows the monster to easily snap its jaws in many directions. If you are successful in avoiding the Daedroth’s flailing attempts to dismember you then go for the torso, destroy the beast’s heart; cut its chest cavity apart. Daedroths have been known to continue desperately fighting even after losing limbs; including their head.  
## Winged Twilight
Watch your head, or you may lose it to Azura’s loyal messengers. Though, what exactly they are attempting to communicate to us mortals still escapes me. Nearly every Winged Twilight I have ever encountered wanted nothing more than my blood covering its talons.  
  
Confronting one of these harpies from hell can be challenging to say the least. In regards to what gear to pack (as if one can plan for a Winged Twilight attack) I would suggest a spear, bow, or anything that can reach them. These daedra tend to gather in small groups and stay to the high ground. By screeching and flapping their wings they attempt to distract the prey. Then when you least expect it, your intestines have become their new nesting.  
  
If you brought some sort of far-reaching weapon, get it out now. Make sure to keep your back against a wall, the Winged Twilights are wary of a caged rat. Many times these daedra will resort to flying in a flurry around their victim, confusing them by their apparent number, striking at random. Do not be fooled, hit at them when they are clearly visible, remain guarded when they are not. Their skin is thin and their vitals densely packed. One clean strike to the chest can kill one.  
## Golden Saint
The Golden Saints I have encountered in my travels are adept fighters. They wield anything from a katana to a longspear, and both expertly. Although these daedra are found infrequently, they often signal the presence of great treasure. Though the "golden" in their name actually refers to their skin which takes on a suitably aurealic sheen; some mistake it to refer to their quarries which can be quite valuable.  
  
Felling a Golden Saint is one of the most difficult battles you will face. They are by far the most powerful daedra I have included in this guide. The saints often use shields in fights and will deflect a great number of blows against them. You may think that you could simply attack with magic, but this would be an unwise decision. Golden Saints reflect a great portion of offensive spells and they will dispel any that do get through. This tendency nearly nullifies a caster’s actions against them.  
  
In short summary: Warriors must confront them head on and hope for the best. Archers can hold back, but the Daedra cannot be held back forever. Thieves will have no luck sneaking up on a Golden Saint; their senses are supernatural to say the least. A mage - is nix fodder.
