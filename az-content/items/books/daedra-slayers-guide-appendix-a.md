## Introduction  
When the possibility of confronting multiple types of daedra exists in a certain situation, obviously one cannot simply prepare for a certain kind. This Appendix will outline the weaponry, armor, and wards and other equipment suggested for daedra-slaying ventures.  
## Weaponry
Due to the oblivion matter which is the make of every daedroth, ordinary weapons such as steel, iron, or chitin will simply have no effect on them. If the absent-minded daedra-slayer attempts to utilize such mundane weapons against a daedroth, the ineffectiveness of them will soon become apparent. Upon each swing, the blade will simply blur against the daedroth’s hide, thrusting right through. The blade will be blurred between oblivion and the mundus, unable to decide what it is striking. As a teacher and warrior, I strongly advice against such foolhardy measures since they tend to confuse the wielder as much as the blade. This leaves the combatant inextricably susceptible to attacks from the daedroth who is none the poorer for the failed attack.  
  
In battle against daedra, it is henceforth necessary to bear arms of refined temperament. This class of weapons includes, but is not constrained to: silver, ebony, glass, enchanted, orcish, and adamantium. Weapons of these types are able to keenly strike daedra, sending them back to Oblivion.  
  
One weapon type which merits special attention here are the numerous Daedric weapons found in Tamriel. Throughout my exploits, I have found that many of the simpler-minded daedra have a strange aversion to daedric weapons. However, some more intelligent daedra such as the Golden Saints and Dremora utilize the weapons themselves. I have concluded simply that this inbred fear stems from the knowledge that daedric souls are trapped within the weapons. Perhaps the daedra can hear their brethren’s tormented cries issuing from the weapons, repelling them from the possibility of sharing their fate. The few daedra who carry the weapons may do so out of shear cruelty to the lesser souls trapped within their weapons. But, having never consulted one of them on the subject, I speak only out of speculation.  
## Armor
There is little to say regarding armor to defend against the daedra’s attacks. As in most combat situations, to each his own. Whatever the fighter is most comfortable wearing, let them bring that to battle. Though it should be noted that some elemental Daedra strongly merit the use of armored masks.  
## Equipment
Many daedra are adept spell-casters and if the daedra-slayer is unprepared for their magical attacks they will soon find themselves to be colder than Molag Bal’s heart or crisper than a Deadlands corpse, and quite dead. The exact spell types cast by various daedra is detailed better in the previous volumes of this series. However, I strongly suggest carrying enchanted wards into battle against the dark kin. Some may choose to bring items with Reflect spells invoked upon them; however, this often proves redundant because many daedra are capable of reflecting the spell back at the caster. I have found that the most enduring protection against daedric magic is an enchantment of Spell Absorption. With this special incantation upon themselves, the warrior will be able to avoid spells and replenish their own magicka reserves if needs be.  
  
Many adventurers cannot afford the pricey enchantments peddled by mages, therefore I offer an alternative. Bring potions and/or scrolls of Restore Health, along with you to heal yourself if you are unfortunate enough to be caught in a magical blast.  
  
This suggestion has not been comprehensive, but I entreat the reader to heed my suggestions and bring along protection against the maelstrom daedra will unleash to avoid being sent back to their masters with their tails between their scaly legs.
