Sunstone heats in the sun. As the player approaches a cluster of sun crystals they will get notifications that "The air is becoming unfortably hot"; if they get closer they will get sun damage. Shaped sunstone can be used for smokeless heating; they just have to be charged (not hard in Lyithdonea). Not a great source of light - mostly heat. It is expensive to cut into rechargeable shapes due to the extreme heat; there is special protective garb or charms used by workers and even then they can only stay nearby for short periods of time. The area around sunstone used to be sandy, but it now glassed over due to the extreme heat. Difficult to transport on ships.
