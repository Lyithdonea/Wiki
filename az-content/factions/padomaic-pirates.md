Also known as the "Black Pirates", this faction hails from the Black Harbor of [[esroniet|Esroniet]]. Their members are a ragtag assortment of [[esri|Esri]], Akaviri, descendants of the Imperial legionnaires who were stranded on Esroniet after the empire's hold over the Padomaic Islands weakened, as well as other races.

There are two clans active in [[lyithdonea|Lyithdonea]]: the Tiger Moth Clan and the Silverleaf Clan.
## Clans
### Tiger Moth Clan
The Tiger Moth clan is primarily composed of descendants of Imperial legionnaires and is the most powerful faction in Esroniet. While most active raiding the Wasabi Run from Cathnoquey, they set up small camps and perform minor raids on other parts of the Padomaic Ocean including Lyithdonea.
### Silverleaf Clan
The Silverleaf Clan has established a remote base for resupplying and repairing their ships in [[kannika-grotto|Kannika Grotto]]. Unlike the hostile Tiger Moths, the Silverleaves are not interested in looting and killing in Lyithdonea. Aside from intermittent thievery to supply their town in the grotto, they have mostly kept to themselves in order to protect the secrecy of their base. They conduct their piracy in other regions. Recently, the Silverleaves have begun making connections with the [[ratcatchers-guild|Ratcatcher's Guild]].
