A variety of roses grow in Lyithdonea.

> [!musings]
> Real world influences:
> * the rose is linked to love, beauty, purity and passion
> * roses can also represent pain, suffering and death.
> * These less romantic representations reappear in European and Near Eastern folklore as a result of Rome's expanding empire and influence over its populace. Throughout ancient Christendom, the red rose is often used to symbolize the blood and agony of the crucifixion of Jesus; the five petals, representing his five wounds. In England, the rosarian prunes red roses carefully, for if the petals fall from a red rose as it is being cut, bad luck will follow. In Italy, fully open roses are not given as a gift because death will befall a relative of the recipient.
> * It is also known as "acicularis", derived from the Latin word "acidula" which translates to "needle-like prickly"
