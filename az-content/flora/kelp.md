In deep water, kelp will grow large enough to produce a bright yellow seed. This seed is used by the [[Chimer]] to produce an oil which is used for a variety of purposes in Lyithdonea including waterproofing their ships. Although it is not extremely flammable, it is occasionally used as a cheap lamp oil.
