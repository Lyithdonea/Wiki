Scout out the [[maormer|Maormer]] ruin the [[sload|Sload]] found in the coral reef (after the key fragments are put into the guild treasure hall).

- The player meets long-dead Maormer water spirits (in the form of ephemeral water snakes - possibly inspired by the Frost Wyrms of Skyrim). They tell the player of the connection between the key fragments in the treasure chests and the ancient seal in their ruin which leads into the lower reaches and finally the buried [[dreugh|Dreugh]] city.
- Turns out the higher echelons of the guild new of this place but were not aware of the connection to the key fragments.
