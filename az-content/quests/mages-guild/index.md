# Motivation
[[mages-guild|Mages Guild]] is mainly here to study the interesting feature of this archipelago that the barriers seem to be relatively loose between it and Oblivion (the 6th barrier). However, each Magister has their own personal interest in research opportunities here.
# Scope
Player receives quests from 5 Magisters; each having approximately 4 quests themed after their area of expertise.

Combat oriented players can choose to join the Order of the Lamp instead which offers parallel quests to those offered by the Magisters.
# Quests
## [[magister-crim|Magister Crim]]
As the Master of Initiates, the player is directed to Magister Crim as their first quest giver. The other Magisters will not offer quests until the player advances sufficiently under Crim.
### 1 - Affinity test
#### Mage
Magister Crim asks the player a series of questions to determine their magical affinity and place them into a particular school. This is similar to the Census and Excise vocational test. If the player protests (high skill), they'll be told that there is always more to learn. After being placed, Crim will tell the player who their lab partner is among the other students and tell them to introduce themselves.
#### Order
Palatinus Medius has a behavioral test for the player to take in order to determine whether they have the necessary qualities to serve as a Tender of the Lamp. This is similar to the Census and Excise vocational test. The player cannot fail this test, but they may be accepted on a probationary basis. This may come into play in a later quest.
### 2 - Clean the lab
#### Mage
Have the player clean up alchemy spills in the alchemy lab. Maybe each spill requires special handling to avoid adverse reactions. The player must use the handbook that Crim provides. If they trigger all of the spills, they will still complete the mission (if they survive), but they receive a reward from Crim commensurate with their performance.
#### Order
A student has triggered a teleportation effect on themselves while cleaning up the lab. You've been tasked by Magister Crim to find them. Based on last week's class on the recall effect, Crim believes they'll be somewhere near the Jermora Resort. They're found on the beach and are reluctant to return.
