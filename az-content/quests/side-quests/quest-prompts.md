| Tablet of Magnus          | In the Trial of Vivec, Vivec mentions that the Tribunal worked from the drafts of Magnus to achieve godhood. Perhaps, I should have an obscure mage in the isles who possesses a manuscript (more like a glowing rune-tablet) produced by the et’Ada of Magic, Magnus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Magicka Edge Axe          | ...good hits with the Magicka Edge Axe convert some of her magicka into extra damage. Very powerful weapon, even more powerful than Lakvan's Daedric Axe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Wraithmail                | Generic wraithmail armor (related to, but a generic version of Alandro Sul's armor): *“It was common before the exodus to bind the ectoplasmic and ashy remains of our Ancestors into enchanted rings, finally fashioning them into ringmail armor known as Wraithmail. The armor was known to protect the wearer from ordinary weapons and was as close as one could get to their ancestors while they yet breathed.”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| King Orgnum’s Coffer      | I should include King Orgnum’s Coffer in the isles (possibly in the possession of the Ouag Tong) since it is one of the only known Maormeri artifacts: *“King Orgnum's Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers clue to it's true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orgnum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery.”* |
| Ichor of winged twilights | Can be found mainly in the daedric shrines. Maybe a black market item in the isles? It is a black liquid that smells “cold, like eucalyptus or mint”. It is used in levitation potions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Band of the Mussitate     | A ring found on a dead Refulgent Erudite in the caverns of Dawn. Casts silence on target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Crystal Rose              | Are fashioned from the frozen burst of a “falling star”. Remember that although the meteoric material originates from Aetherius, it must pass through Oblivion to get to Nirn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Orange Ward               | An artifact from Infernace which grants complete protection from fire damage. Probably for a short time - good for avoiding traps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| K'kelli Mask              | A magical mask worn by the Nolmer which is said to be fashioned using the soul of a Magna Ge. Grants some powerful star magic (is probably mostly ineffectual for the player if they acquire one).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| "City Factions" | Have some city-type factions such as an Acrobatic Camp or a Prostitutes Guildhouse. Or maybe a school dedicated to one skill, such as security or athletics. Remember that Azura is worshipped, but the other daedra are still honored and the brothel could serve Sanguine whose sphere is hedonistic debauchery. |
## Targrip's Protonymic

NEEDS REVIEW 

- After descending to the Second-Half-Truths Caverns underneath the Isle of Dawn, the player learns of the Illuvitar, Targrip.
- Targrip has been blessed by Azura with invulnerability, therefore he can only be defeated by uttering his protonymic.
- The player can obtain the protonymic only by talking to four strange “creatures” he/she encounters while travelling through the caverns.
- First Creature: The Climbing Rock, When the player approaches this “wall” it speaks to them saying: “Neophyte Neonymic, where is 1? The first is one, RESUM, to find the four leave the floor.” OK
- The player must then activate the wall which will then warp (climb) them to the top of the cliff, where they continue on.
- Second Creature: Whistle Wyrd, as the player approaches they see a small Bosmer man whistling (use the activator to replay the whistling sound over and over, so that it continues during dialogue) over an underground lake of water. When the player speaks to him this is what he says: “I see none, only one. The twin of first is second, ANAE; the winding whistle finds the bridge.”
- The Bosmer takes a step towards the chasm, continuing to whistle. A pathway of stepping pillars appears across the lake.
- Third Creature: Finger of God, the third creature is a rock pillar (use a Solstheim runed rock). It says this to the player: “Three is the devil devil devil, ALMSIVI, to ope the door, chant the death-key.”
- The player then speaks “ALMSIVI” to the rock by activating it then displaying a messagebox. The Finger of God then falls backwards, revealing an entry to the darker depths of the caverns.
- Fourth Creature: The Fourth Star, the last “creature” appears as a floating (script to move up, then down) star (use existing crystal mesh) in a very dark chamber, it is the only illumination. The Fourth Star says this: “The changing digit of final is 4, EN, The darkest darkness of the night sky is the trail to Oblivion.”
- A new spell “Protonymic of Targrip” is added to the player’s spellbook.
- The player must figure out that The Fourth Star’s riddle means to search the room for the “darkest” spot. This turns out to be a hole to crawl through in the ceiling.
- After crawling through the hole, the player is left in a shadowy hall of pillars reaching up into the darkness (use Azuran Daedric Architecture, combined with ruinous rocks strewn about. Puffs of steam issue from the rock clusters.).
- At the end of the hall, Targrip is standing on a pedestal of tangled roots, he does not attack.
- Targrip: “Up wall, over water, through rock, and seeing darkness. You find me. Have you uncovered the other half of Her? This is to know, to know is to listen, to listen is to die. The Twilight Prince has gathered your mind to this place that you might die of listening to know. This is what you will know: Grey is the color of everything, change is the power of not-stasis, the devil devil devil creates a contrast, and AZURA EN: The Final Word is Azura.”
- The only option after this is “goodbye”, then the player must cast the protonymic spell on Targrip when he begins attacking the player. With the spell effect on Targrip, messageboxes appear separately: “RESUM” “ANAE” “ALMSIVI” “EN” with the last syllable, EN, Targrip vanishes (cast an area frost spell at his death location). 
- The only thing Targrip leaves behind is his Bandy Totem (use regular Bloodmoon totem, but place an Illuvitar scale on the end). The item does not need to be worn to receive its effects. It just needs to be in the player’s inventory.
- Effects: Grey Void – Spell Absorption 30pts, Silence; Powerword: Fortify Speechcraft 20pts
- To leave the Second-Half-Truths Caverns, the player just needs to take the totem. The player will then be dropped off near the entrance to the caves.
