[[ha-questgiver-2|HA Questgiver 2]] says that a noble in the manor district has asked for protection while he and his entourage make their annual visit to their ancestral tomb. They meet you at the docks, you take a boat, and then they travel there. You get to leave them there, because screw escort quests.
