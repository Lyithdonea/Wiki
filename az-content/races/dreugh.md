## Biology
Dreugh are half-human, half-octopus in appearance with crustaceous shells which produce a waxy substance. [^1] [^2] They are described as a semi-aquatic troglophile form of humans. [^3] 

> [!Note]
> A troglophile, rather than simply one that "loves" a cave, which is the literal meaning of its name, is a cave-dwelling animal that does not live entirely in the dark. A troglophile is an organism that can live all its life either inside or outside a cave, so a troglophile is to a cave as an amphibian is to water.

Dreugh undergo a process called Karvinasim for one year of their life when they walk on land. After they are ready to return to the water, they will meff up fibrous balls of grom. Meffing involves the dreugh consuming the skin and organs required for land dwelling and then vomiting them into balls of grom. [^4]

Dreugh Queens enter periods of self-incubation where they are indisposed to deal with other affairs. [^5]

Alongside the common Dreugh seen in the base game, Dreugh Man o’ War’s are also mentioned along with the Dreugh Warlord seen in Koal Cave. [^6]
## Culture
Dreughs are said to have lived in castles of glass and coral. [^7] They have knowledge of the Water Face which cannot lie and they taught this ability to Vivec. [^8] Some of their names are not easy to spell. [^9] Dreugh are sometimes referred to as an elvish race: Vivec calls them the "Altmer of the sea" and they have also been called cepholomer. [^10] [^11]
## History
It is said that the Dreugh ruled the world a long time ago from their "slave oceans", possibly in a previous kalpa. At that time, Molag Bal was their chief and assumed a spiny and armored appearance which was suitable for life in the sea. [^12] [^13] An entity known as the Ruddy Man is credited with being the father of the Dreugh. [^14] It is possible that the Dreugh lost their hold over the world due to a curse. [^15]
