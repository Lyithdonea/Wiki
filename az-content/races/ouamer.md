They refer to [[azura|Azura]] as the "Mother Soul". Read [[elves-of-the-southern-isles|Elves of the Southern Isles]] for more information on the Ouamer.
#### Motivations (Main Storyline)
The Ouamer, like the Ashlanders, desire to be left alone. The appearance of the polyliths force them back into contact with their estranged siblings of [[house-azura|House Azura]]. But even after the events have concluded, they will likely return to their secluded way of life.
