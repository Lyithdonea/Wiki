## Is Lyithdonea an official location?
No. Lyithdonea is the creation of Melchior Dahrk intended to fit within the Elder Scrolls universe.
## How long has Lyithdonea been in development?
I started working on Lyithdonea in 2007. It was inspired by an old quest mod called "The Five Keys of Azura" which I mistook to be referring to keys as in small islands. I had already imagined a tropical paradise filled with Azura-worshippers before I looked at the mod and realized it was great but completely different than what I was expecting. The spark had been lit, however, and I began writing down my ideas and sketches in a notebook which ultimately turned into this project.
## How can I learn more about the project?
More information can be found here on the [[index|Lyithdonea Wiki]]. Warning that venturing beyond the main page can reveal spoilers and WIP information. The wiki is a living site which is constantly being added onto.
## When will the Nexus version be updated?
The next [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43749) release will come after significant progress has been made on one or more questlines to add more playability to the mod.
## How can I explore the latest version of the mod?
The latest version is hosted on GitHub. Here are instructions on how to [[downloading-from-github|download from GitHub]].
## How can I follow development?
If you want live updates on the project, join the [Lyithdonea Discord server](<https://discord.gg/w9xE9qxaPX>).
## How can I help?
There are many ways that you can help with the project. The fastest to jump into if you have some background with the Construction Set is interior creation. The wiki has [instructions for claiming interiors](<https://www.lyithdonea.wiki/resources/contributing/interior-claims>).

If you have skills in other areas (assets, exteriors, writing, questing, etc), reach out to me on Discord!
