Interior claims are managed through the [Interior Claims project](https://github.com/orgs/Lyithdonea/projects/8) on GitHub. Each active claim can be clicked on to see more information. A GitHub account is not required, but contributors with an account can be added to the Lyithdonea Organization and formally assigned to interiors they claim.

> [!Note]
> The claim names are identical to the cell names in `MD_Azurian Isles.esm`.

The claims page can be filtered by settlement vs. wilderness, status, type, area, or assignee. It can also be changed from tabular format to a kanban board if preferred.
