## Furniture
* Poor (`az_furn_bamboo, furn_de_ex, AB_Furn_DeEx`)
	* The bamboo set is used as a "poor" equivalent throughout Lyithdonea. It should be used in places where `de_p` and `com_p` are used on Vvardenfell.
	* de_ex can also be used.
* Mid (`AB_Furn_DeMid`)
	* There is currently no replacement for middle class furniture so DeMid from OAAB_Data can be used in middle class interiors (e.g. merchants, prosperous taverns, etc.)
* Rich (`AB_Furn_DeRch, furn_de_r`)
	* There is currently no replacement for rich furniture so the vanilla de_r set and additions from the OAAB_Data DeRch set can be used in high class interiors.
## Miscellaneous
* Poor
	* Clay (`az_misc_clay, AB_Misc_DeClay, misc_de_pot_mottled_01`)
	* Stone (`az_misc_stn`)
	* Wood (`az_misc_wood, misc_com_wood`). 
* Mid
	* Silverware (`az_misc_silverware, misc_com_silverware`)
	* Blue Clay and Glass (`AB_Misc_DeBlue, misc_de_pot_blue`)
	* Ceramic (`AB_Misc_DeCeramic, misc_de_bowl_orange_green_01`)
	* Green Clay and Glass (`AB_Misc_DeGreen, Misc_DE_glass_green_01, misc_de_pot_green_01`)
	* Yellow Glass (`AB_Misc_DeYelGlass, misc_de_glass_yellow_01, misc_de_bowl_glass_yellow_01`).
* Rich
	* Shellware (`az_Misc_Shellware`)
	* Silverware (`az_misc_silverware, misc_com_silverware`)
	* Quartz (`az_misc_quartz`)
