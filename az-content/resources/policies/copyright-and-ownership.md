The by-sa license is a copyleft license, meaning the text of the articles can be copied, modified, and redistributed as long as the new version acknowledges the authors of the article and grants the same freedoms to others.

## Using Materials from the Lyithdonea Wiki
If you want to use content from this site, you can do so, but you must follow the by-sa license. This entails the following:

- Your materials in turn must be licensed under our by-sa license.
- You must give attribution to the article from which the content was taken.
- You must give access to the page where the content was used.

You may fulfill the last two obligations by directly linking back to the article hosted on the site as well as the history page of the article. For example, if you were to use the article "House Azura" from our site, an example notice might read as follows:

```
This article is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">​Creative Commons by-sa license</a>. It uses material from the Lyithdonea Wiki article <a href="https://www.lyithdonea.wiki/factions/house-azura">​"House Azura"</a>.
```

In the event that you find a page or site where the above steps have not been taken, please post something in the [Lyithdonea Discord server](https://discord.gg/w9xE9qxaPX) to let us know of the situation, even if it has already been resolved.
