## Spriggan
* **Location**: Woodlands and rural areas are of the Imperial Province of High Rock.
* **History**: These reclusive creatures are considered by some scholars to be in the genus Illyandi or part of the Sylphim or Faerie chain. They are all but immune to physical attack, in fact capable of gaining power from such offense.
## Orcs
* **Location**: Everywhere, particularly the southern Wrothgarian mountains near Wayrest.
* **History**: Universally reviled for their belligerence and savagery, orcs are particularly common in the Iliac Bay where they are rumored to be rebuilding their ancient capitol.
## Centaur
* **Location**: Forests and pastureland throughout the Bay.
* **History**: Ancient and mysterious creatures, alternately worshipped and despised, centaurs are said to be followers of the Old Ways of Tamriel.
## Scorpion
* **Location**: The Alik'r Desert and the blighted Dak'fron of Hammerfell.
* **History**: The Giant Scorpions are aggressive, intelligent hunters that have fallen like a plague in the Alik'r Desert. They avoid human settlements, but have killed many a lone traveler.
## Ice Daedra, or Frost Daedra
* **Location**: Oblivion
* **History**: Little is commonly known about the ice or frost daedra and its brethren. They are emissaries and assassins of the Daedra Princes of Oblivion and are as cold in their murders as the infernal mist that surrounds them.
## Fire Daedra
* **Location**: Oblivion
* **History**: Little is commonly known about the fire daedra and its brethren. They seem to be most commonly used by their masters, the Daedra Princes of Oblivion, as agents of destruction in its least subtle form.
## Vampire
* **Location**: Everywhere
* **History**: Cruel, cunning, and immortal predators, vampires hunt the night, sometimes singly sometimes in packs. To what degree they have infiltrated human society, spreading death and the dread disease vampirism, is best lift unimagined.
## Dreugh
* **Location**: The Abecean Sea, the Iliac Bay, lakes and rivers.
* **History**: The grotesque Dreugh is primarily an aquatic scavenger, though it does seem to have amphibian capacities. According to legend, the Dreugh are the cursed remnants of a once proud civilization.
## Daedroth
* **Location**: Oblivion
* **History**: Little is commonly known about the Daedroth and its brethren. The Daedra Princes of Oblivion, who command the Daedroth, often employ them as guards or on simple assassinations when brute strength and fortitude is required.
