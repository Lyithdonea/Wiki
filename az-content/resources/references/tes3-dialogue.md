## Topics
### dreugh
Dreugh are ancient sea monsters, half-human, half-octopus in appearance. Dreugh are hunted for their hides, which are used for making armor, and dreugh wax, a tough, waxy substance with modest magical properties, scraped from dreugh shells. \- **Hunter / Barbarian** ^545563
### dreugh wax
Dreugh wax is a tough, waxy substance with modest magical properties, scraped from dreugh shells. Dreugh are powerful aquatic creatures, and hunting them for their hides and wax is a dangerous occupation. \- **Tendris Vedran / Anarenen** ^5e6ff9
### water creatures
Three creatures are commonly encountered in Vvardenfell's coastal and water environments. The mudcrab, and its larger cousins the king mudcrab and mudcrab titan, are large but unaggressive. Slaughterfish are small but very aggressive, and the larger varieties, the blind slaughterfish and the electric slaughterfish, are quite dangerous. But the most dangerous water creature is the large and powerful dreugh and the dreugh man o'war. \- **Gudling the Rascal / Briring** ^a953dd
