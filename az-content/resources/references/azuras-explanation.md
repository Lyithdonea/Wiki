## Azura speaking to the Nerevarine
[Azura speaks of how the Nerevarine was not tricked during his conquest against House Dagoth.]

[[Azura]]: With the Heart gone, Red Mountain holds no purpose. Its stability wavers. The balance of the Mundus has weakened. What has been done could not be avoided, Nerevar. The Devil Dagoth and the False Gods drained the Heart to its basest.

Nerevarine: The Heart?

Azura: The Heart of Lorkhan, Heart of the World, the First Stone. The Mortal God is responsible for the mortal plane, surely you know this already.

Nerevarine: But I wish to hear your side, Azura.

Azura: I will not speak in detail of that un-time, as it is disturbing to recall. I watched and waited.

Nerevarine: Perhaps, some other time you will tell me.

Azura: Perhaps. [Azura pauses]

Azura: Â Nerevar. The Heart was much more than an object of personal power as the false gods treated it. The thrice damned knew this yet greed warranted a cause to break their oath to ME. As they sapped away the divine power, they ate away at the very soul of Nirn. The First Stone has been banished from the mortal plane by you, Nerevar. I know not where it lies, but it resides not in the halls of Oblivion.

Nerevarine: You deceived me?

Azura: Deception? No. Think hard Nerevar, remember the cycle of Dawn and Dusk. The Dawn has long passed; mortals have been living in the noontide, oblivious to the timeline of this sphere.

Dusk follows the dawn, dawn follows the dusk. This is the cycle. Both are eras of eclipse. However, only the DAWN was dark and clouded. Soon the DUSK of Nirn will blanket this world and the true heroes of this age will emerge.

Nerevarine: You speak of the end.

Azura: Not the end, Nerevar, not the beginning either; But a shift. A shift away from the oppressive regime of Exactness to the accepting friendship of the Limitless

Nerevarine: What are you saying, Azura?

Azura: You look weary. Another time. Another place.

[Azura talks more about the Morrowind Mainquest, and her TRUE plan for the Nerevarine.]

Nerevarine: I have come as you requested, Lady Azura. Have you more to tell me?

Azura: I was unclear the last time you saw me. I wish to make it apparent what you accomplished at Red Mountain.

The downfall of the Tribunal was necessary. The Demons Triangulate stood in the path of the passing hours. Vivec held his people under a fist of stone, he threatened with his very presence among them. Almalexia plotted against the ones she swore as lovers. Sotha Sil blasphemed the Daedra countless times and was the author of stolen godhood. However, even after the awakening of their brother, the devil Dagoth, none among them performed the necessary act: the Heart had to be unfettered.

I have already discussed why this must occur: For the furtherance of the cycle. Come, Nerevar, surely you are not as self-righteous as they were?

Azura: I believe it is time.

Neravarine: Time?

Azura: For you to hear my side.

When the greatest of the first spirits resided in the void, I was there. When Lorkhan brought his proposition forth, I heard. When the others died to create, I watched. The rest and I stood back, unwilling to take part in forming the Mundus. Why was I averse to it? The void was well with me then, spirits could converse simply. There was no need to travel across planes. The simplicity of it was pleasing. The lesser spirits orbited the greater and ideas could fluctuate without limitation.

Even now, I do not regret my decision. Although I am filled with love for my followers, I do not envy the Aedra who are eternally bound to this world; unable to loose themselves and never again free to their own thoughts.

Nirn has always been in a cycle towards its Dusk. Every day must end; even one which is eras long. I have merely aided the cycle of which I am matron. Could I do any less?

Neravarine: So you intend for Nirn to be destroyed and for all life to perish?

Azura: Why do you attempt to place me into such a small box, Nerevarine?

Azura: Nirn will not be destroyed. The Heart was a key which kept the barriers between the Mundus and the Oblivion contrasted. It was the soul, granting divinity and holiness. Many would downplay its significance, but I know the truth of what you have accomplished.

Nirn will be absorbed into Oblivion. Every last offspring whether mer, man or beast will return to the plane of their lord, Aedroth or Daedroth. What comes after is myth.

Azura: Go now, friend. Speak of this if you will, but it shall do little good or ill.
