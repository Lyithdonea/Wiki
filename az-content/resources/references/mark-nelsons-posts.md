## On Daedra as Good or Evil

As some have said, they are neither. Some are certainly more aggressive than others. Some have a greater tolerance for mortals. But, I wouldn't say that any are good or evil. Some people think of Azura as a "good" daedra. That could end up being a very dangerous misconception in the Elder Scrolls world.
