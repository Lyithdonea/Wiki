description: The Trial of Vivec started as a forum thread created by a fan named "zingbat" on the Official Elder Scrolls Forums, who proposed a roleplay about the persecution of Vivec for his crimes. Developer Michael Kirkbride hopped on and went with the idea, later inviting other developers get involved as a big roleplaying event.

## Zingbat (02/26/04):

I propose for, role-playing sake, that we judge Vivec and the Tribunal in an improvised Daggerfall type tribunal. If Vivec is condemned then he gets to rotten for ages in a dark imperial prison cell.

We need a jury. Anyone who comes to this forum will do.

A judge, someone who knows something of Tamriel law and application of law.

One or more acusation advocates.

One or more defense advocates.

So lets exaust all evidences and look throug them at the light of Imperial law and see if Vivec should punished. If neccessary we create new and just laws. But let not justice be undone.

We also need an acusator and witnesses and the acusator would be me.

I acuse the Tribunal of the murder of Nerevar and usurpation of power by illegal means and without a contract with the Dark Brotherhood.

I acuse the Tribunal of retaining and hiding a valuable and very powerful magic artifact called the heart of lhorkan and use it for his own needs without first consulting the Emperor. Considering the fact that the Tribunal has put in danger the entire world of Nirn and created that abomination Dagoth Uhr and the Corprus plage. These is very serious indeed.

I acuse the Tribunal of falsely claming to be Gods without the aprovation or intervention of the 8 divinities. Tribunal godhood is an insult and mockery to the gods and corrupts people faith in the eight divinities.

I acuse the Tribunal, with his Godhood claims to conspire and try to weaken the power of the emperor, just like they tried to usurp the throne of the Nerevarine and succeced.

We first need a judge, advocates, witnesses and a jury then the real tribunal will be open. Anyone is ineterested ?
## Vehk (02/26/04):

VIVEC daughter of Mphaal and from her male sons and [forbidden] I have heard and the voice of the weak [forbidden] of the men who are fighting [forbidden] of raging women who curse and afflict and cause pain they have descended against them Vendor-sellers, Etadachiel and Padachiel, The Emperor the great and The Unnamed Vendor and Sahtiel and seized them and by the tufts of hair and the tresses of their heads and broke the horns which were high and tied them by the tufts of hair of their heads and said to them "remove that which you have cursed" and they said to him "from the pain of our heart we cursed and from the bitterness of our palate we resolved to curse" I have made you swear and adjure you in the name of Mnemol and Etadachiel and Padachiel and The Emperor the Great and The Unnamed Vendor and Sahtiel that you release [forbidden] and free [forbidden] VIVEC daughter of Mphaal and [forbidden] male and female from [forbidden] all the curses [forbidden] cursed and from the curses of [forbidden] and the mother and from the curse of the prostitute [forbidden] and the fetus and from the curse of the employee and employer who stole the wage and from the curse of the brothers who did not divide truthfully among themselves and from the curses of all people who curse in the name of idol demons and their surrenderings you are the healer you are the healer who heals sicknesses with words you are the healer who turns away the sicknesses and the curses of those who cursed VIVEC daughter of Mphaal in the name of the Aedra and Etadachiel and Padachiel and The Emperor and The Unnamed Vendor and heal and annul the curses of those who curse VIVEC daughter of Mphaal.

## Vehk (02/26/04):

Come, little pets, shave me to the bones. Sit on the mercy seat and render unto me a world picture. Build me a cage from your dead fathers. Ignore that ache behind the eye of recognition that simply cannot be some ancient advance on your cave mothers now sown some three thousand years hence. Or can it... you, all my daring fruit? Lion, choke not on the newborn sun. He was so young the day he drew you out.
## Zingbat (02/27/04):

Citizens of the Empire, i represent a group of people who want to remain anonymous. I have mouths to feed and my position in the Imperial court is crytical. My accusations could be ignored if it was not for the pressure for them to go forward. So this judgement must be carried. With or without the Tribunal a statement must be made to the people.

Before i present the accusations again, there some things that must be clarified. First if there is no judge and no advocate to acuse the Tribunal then the mob will have to do. If there is an Imperial officer present he may take the rule of jury and judge. I cannot participate because i am making the accusations.

This is not the judgment of the Cyrodills or the Empire. This is not the judgement of Imperial law itself. This is the judgement of the Tribunal against the accusations that were placed against them. The outcome of this judgement is what this improvised Tribunal will do and its only purpose is to serve justice itself without favors.

If the mob decides with their heart then justice will not be served. Mercy is for the weak, mercy brings corruption and decline of valors. The Empire will decline and the world will be a dark place to live on. Justice should be applyied with whatever facts we know because grave acts have been commited and we know who did them.

I place my accusations again and ask for you to judge by actual Imperial and to take in consideration the changes that happened in the last days of the Tribunal.

First Accusation:

I acuse the Tribunal of the murder of Nerevar and usurpation of power by illegal, and most grave of all, to be unetical and immoral. By this i mean one of these: without the participation of the Morag Tong or the Dark Brotherhood, without first establishing alliances with the major rulers. In other words a cruel, savage murder, without any humanity or honor.

What is your veredict for this accusation ?

Second Accusation:

I acuse the Tribunal of retaining and hiding a valuable and very powerful magic artifact called the heart of lhorkan and use it for his own needs without first consulting the Emperor and the official organizations for regulating the use and discovery of new magical artifacs.

What is your veredict for this accusation ?

Third Accusation:

I accuse the Tribunal has put in danger the entire world of Nirn and created that abomination Dagoth Uhr and the Corprus plage. Of not informing the Empire of its consequences to full extent, so that the proper actions could be taken by Imperial authority to correct the mistakes.

What is your veredict for this accusation ?

Fourth Accusation:

I acuse the Tribunal of falsely claming to be Gods without the aprovation or intervention of the 8 divinities and their highest hierarchy of priests. I contest the decision of the Emperor at that time and ask for it to be revised because it was only possible by the use of dark magics against his venerable person.

What is your veredict for this accusation ?

Fifth Accusation:

I acuse the Tribunal, with his Godhood claims to conspire and try to weaken the power of the emperor with inflamatory and anty-impireal messages inside the sermons.

What is your veredict for this accusation ?

Please whenever you make a stamenent fundament your veredicts with the proper sources and certified documents and dates from the Imperial Library historical records.
## Vehk (02/27/04):

Dumb, deaf dreamers,

You struggle to make the idea of my trial conform to your standards. To this, I refuse. But to swim in the new phlogiston, I will submit myself to a challenge of accountability—

--under Dunmeri rules.

What is required is a Tribunal, silly Incarnates, which accuses me of crime or crimes, and to which my final judgment is foregone unless I save myself. And a High Council to sway or solidify their position, or to generally throw stones and verses. And eye-witnesses, whose presence has taken me awhile to...secure.

And since Vehk and Vehk will not give ground on his soul to any but his equals, I appoint my own Tribunal to charge me. And I command them to do their best to damn me, even if it tugs at their conscience. Thus do I appoint to mythic status:

Mercy- Allerleirauh, my sweet Nord, so ironic that my heart sits at the feet of the daughter of CHEMUA, YSMIR, HOAG. Do your best, Mother.

Mystery- Hasphat Antabolis, Dwemer-infested and confused, so fitting to sit in my brother's seat, what shall you bring to this?

And Mastery- my little Nigedo whirling, I expect the deepest strokes from you. Enigma, you've become Enemy. Wrest the right to Teach from me, or I will have Kha-bul-Nuit vomit on your mind.

Thence does this Tribunal charge me and hold me to debate and parley, and against every charge they bring I shall either win through my proofs or eat the seven swords.

The High Council shall be the rest of you unwashed masses, representatives from the world's five quarters. Here, I give you a razored stone. The first is free.

And one last solemn oath—I will bring the only eye-witnesses that matter, channeling their voice-deeds by way of the Provisional House.

Expect Nerevar, Dagoth-Ur, and my lover-liar Alandro Sul.

Zingbat: rude talker, I have appointed my birds. Choke on them.
## Vehk (02/27/04):

Mercy,

Pray let me put on my Water-Face. It won't take a day.

And, yes, meanwhile, let them speak.
## Vehk (02/27/04):

As lord of the middle air I bless these proceedings to earth and earth, where the meddlers take no stones except to blood, as blood IS blood, and to the cracking of bone, as bone IS bone, and so to crack and answer and fall before the one and one, I call you Dragon as brother and king, flame-faced, turgid, accounted, crowned in hours, see this as wanted and so to write, set letter, set in time, and I call you Wife, sister and queen, hole and throne, wet, spending, moan'ed before marriage, see this as wanted and so to wed, led-to-loved, set in never, GO DOWN AE ALTADOON DEN, for trailed it is in slime we make our babes and the walker heeds no mock of dirt, until you, until you, there, I call you there, I call you Proud One, brother-by-death, worker, admonisher of waiting ones, the takers of wage without, beaten, unmoved, willed to rise by morning, see this as wanted and so to build, bricked and mortared, set like walls, and there so set as hearth, by whose heat I call you Rain, maiden unmade, bled, untouched and so to red ever, unto the earth, as egg IS egg, see this as wanted, and so to shower, red unruined, set in wonder, BIRTH AE PADHOME, as I call you Wrapped In Rags as self and self, as handheld summer, grinding wise, all our chieftains turned to crops, RKHET the Taker now took, for this is wanted, set your seven swords, sensible if left for dead, SEE NOW GHARTOK AE SALOMET, so shall I call you Womb-Ridden, spoilt spiller, sister-whore, come and come, match black swallow of these, the running monies, whose vendors lay playing golden, star and city, all of one to your only bed, because this is wanted, IS want, and so to swell them, set and entered, SEHT AE DWEM, I call you Wounded as my war brother, speared and thrown down, STENDR, rebuilt like mercy, lake-faced and lamp'd, spoke in water, this is wanted, give it grace, set in stillborn heavens, AE, I call you Lock-step, math athlete, theorem-teethed biter, grand answer, stay skyward from your line, symbol-gutter, this is wanted, set sequence, may you trace it for them with string, grim engine JHNAL AE THE EARTH AM, through Eight I bless it EARTH AM AS EARTH AM
Hasphat Antabolis (02/27/04):

Vehk, Thief, why do you drag me into your self-indulgent little drama? You know very well what I have always accused you of, but I still come here unwillingly, as I tire quickly of your bluster and misdirection, and I doubt you will abide by any judgment by this "Tribunal" or any other. Your boundless arrogance claims no peers for itself, no matter what you might say sweetly now to soothe the mob.

That I come at all is in service of history and the truth, two things that you undoubtedly know much of but share very little. And I hate a mob, even one baying for your blood.

I suppose I am intended as a prosecutor of sorts, but I decline that role (for now). l will clear you of the destruction of the Dwemer, at least. All accounts of Red Mountain agree that you were on the battlefield when the Dwemer vanished, not in the Heart-Chamber where the crucial deed was committed. By whom? Kagrenac? Nerevar? Dagoth Ur? It is not even clear that any crime was committed -- perhaps the Dwemer removed themselves to another world using the power of the Heart. Perhaps they were destroyed, by their own arrogance ... or by Nerevar. Why does he not stand here accused? Channel him, if you will, Vehk! I would love to hear his words (from your mouth).

I may return, I may not. This spectacle only feeds your ego, the center of events as always. You love to play the prophet, but I remember (as few seem to) that your proper title is General.
## Vehk (02/27/04):

As Vehk and Vehk I hereby answer, my right and my left, with black hands.

Vehk the mortal did murder the Hortator.

Vehk the God did not, and remains as written.

And yet these two are the same being. And yet are not, save for one red moment.

Know that with the Water-Face do I answer, and so cannot be made to lie.
## Allerleirauh (02/28/04):

Well, Vehk. It seems we must punish the mortal, then.
## Vehk (02/28/04):

Alas, Love, you cannot:

From Sermon Thirty-Five: "...that virility is dead, by which I mean at least replaced."
## Nigedo (02/28/04):

It seems to me that Vehk the God has other deeds to answer for; the betrayal of the inheritance of Veloth and misdirection of the Chimeri Exodus.

When did Mephala grant his mantle to you false spirit and St. Veloth pass to your care the walking way of the Chimer?

But these questions will likely not satisfy the mass that desires less 'metaphysical' answers.

You are mortal now are you not? Or do you still retain some hidden vestige of godhood?
## Vehk (02/28/04):
Nigedo: It seems to me that Vehk the God has other deeds to answer for; the betrayal of the inheritance of Veloth and misdirection of the Chimeri Exodus.

Proof before fiction, little Nigedo. Play by the rules.
Nigedo: You are mortal now are you not? Or do you still retain some hidden vestige of godhood?

Perhaps...yes, perhaps I am mortal. Now. Yes.

...perhaps I am. Deep stroke indeed. Good.

But the mortal Vehk before this one is not the one who stands here now, for I am Remnant. And innocent of the charge you would bring onto the head of my former life.
## Hasphat Antabolis (02/28/04):

As usual, Vehk would like to evade responsibility using metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. He would like us to believe that his mortal self and his (self-proclaimed) god self are two different beings entirely. The mortal Remnant of a god is therefore not responsible for the doings of his mortal precursor. To this I say, humbug! Vehk is Vehk is Vehk. If you remember your former crimes, own up to them and be done with it.
## Vehk (02/28/04):

Mercy and Mastery and Mystery. You cry for an Exactitude of the universe from me when its very Chancellor broke its astrolabe in half when I was born. You ghost-touch like the cousin-spirits that showed me the the face of the marriage of broken worlds, but refuse to speak what you see. You swear by the egg-layered universe but refuse to see beyond the if-then of my ancestors, not my ancestors. You hammer against the Cloven Duality as if it's one, then two, then one, all of a row. And to this I tell you in Truth: Red Mountain made me exist before I did.
## Allerleirauh (02/28/04):

Is this your water face, Vehk? No riddles.
## Hasphat Antabolis (02/28/04):

Ha! Asking Vehk to speak without riddles is like asking a snake to please stand up and walk, just this once.
## Vehk (02/28/04):
Aquiantus: Or is it like Vehk the God existed before Vehk the Mortal and then the mortal did commit murder to steal Vehk the God into himself?

Is it very alike. And perhaps born of golden wisdom and powers that should have been forever unalike.
## Vehk (02/28/04):
Nigedo: Then let us delve deeper into the apparent mystery of your present mortality. From whence does it proceed? Does it have no past, no ancestor, no precedent? Do you not walk Time's straight line with all mortals? Then see what lies behind you, or dare you not look over your shoulder?

I will leave it to others to find where I have written all this before. But when Vehk the mortal reached into the Heart, he ceased to be anything except for what he wished to be. The axis erupted. There was an exact cracking, an instant of pure Aurbis, his hands burnt black by that ever-nil of static change, and Vivec the god who had never been had always been. A whole universe swelled up to legitimize his throne... as the old universe, where Vehk the mortal still lapped up Godsblood, warped itself to accept its new equivalent. And like all things magical it simply could not happen, could not Be. Red Mountain was the intersection of the Is-Is Not as it was of old, its center point, and it did not hold. And so the Dragon, having broken, saw fit to heal, turning into the world you know. Except now Vivec the God was alive before his own birth, which had, in fact, really happened in the death of the last universe. Hard to grasp in three-dimensional thought? Why, of course it is. And so that is why some semblance of my anguished personal reconciliation found its way into my own scripture. Why did I leave the Nerevarine two accounts of his death, one that I could have easily erased from the minds of my own people? Because he is Hortator, GHARTOK PADHOME AE ALTADOON DUNMERI, my lord and king in this world and the last, and as Vehk and Vehk I murdered him, then raised him, then taught to him to know, and so would I have it when he came to me at last that he decide. I give you this as Vivec.
## Allerleirauh (02/28/04):
Vehk: But when Vehk the mortal reached into the Heart, he ceased to be anything except for what he wished to be.

The wish remains a part of you. Your intentions are constant, from the mortal form, through the form of the god, to the form of the remnant. My judgement is that Vehk the mortal is indeed the same being as Vehk the god, and Vehk the remnant. You became a god, as you have said, through your own will, and that will you have not abandoned.
## Vehk (02/28/04):

So, Mercy, a Girl of White Glamour indeed. And a puzzlebox-logician at either side. Well, then, I'll tell you now as I told you then: I am a letter written in uncertainty and thus you cannot hold me. But you seem certain that the wish fulfilled is the same as the wishmaker. What says the Council?
## Yeah (02/28/04):

What high price would that be? He was born a mortal and he'll die a mortal. I would hardly call living life as you were meant to live it a punishment, much less one appropriate for murder.

There is also, of course, the way he dealt with the ashlanders. Why didn't you follow through with Nerevar's promise to allow them a place on the grand council, Vehk? Why did you alienate them so much from the other Dunmer?

And why did you kill Nerevar in the first place? Perhaps it is time for all of these questions to be answered. Or is it time to hear from Nerevar?
## Vehk (02/28/04):
Yeah: Or is it time to hear from Nerevar?

I can see that this court will not trust the words of Nerevar if they come from my own mouth, even if channeled. I therefore claim my right and tradition as Son of Mephala to open my twin gate, a source that none can deny. I motion for the Tribunal to summon Azura to these proceedings, to speak on the one, true Nerevar's behalf. What say you?
## Allerleirauh (02/28/04):

Thief, when cornered you show your true colors... I think you are stalling for time. Can you bring Nerevar before us or not?

My sources tell me that the summoning date for Azura is Hogithum, 21st First Seed, three weeks distant. And that we would need a Dunmer priest. Dunmer priests, I suppose, are in no short supply. But do you expect this court to wait so long? I suspect that you will quietly slip away, and we will never see Azura here...
## Vehk (02/28/04):

I swear on the first and last she will come if summoned on her proper day, three weeks hence, a loophole I have no control over. It surely is my right as the accused, sweet Mercy, to ask for this. After all, what have I to gain if I am guilty, save Azura's condemnation and therefore no choice but to face this court in full shame and punishment thereafter?
## Ainoryl (02/29/04):

Where have the common people of Tamriel stated that the Tribunal put their lives in danger? How did the Tribunal ever let loose a dangerous plague?

The tribunal have their failings. In light of recent events in morrowind, these failings have become startlingly apparent. But the 'common' people didn't worship them for thousands of years because they felt they were in danger. Vivec did many, many good and beneficial things for his people, and by nearly all accounts was heralded as a wonderous hero to be emulated by the common man. Dagoth Ur released plagues, and that was no fault of the tribunals. If anything, they constructed the ghostgate to contain these plagues.

This tribunal of 'judges' is a good thing. Comprised of some of the most knowledgable people in tamrielic lore that live. I urge all members of this high council to be patient, and hold your judgements until more of this trial has passed. There is much more to come, methinks. Patience.
## Hasphat Antabolis (03/01/04):
Naion: What says Antabolis?

What, summon a Daedra to pardon the Devil? Oh my, why not?
## Vehk (03/01/04):

As we seem settled, then, we should pick our priest. And, as I do not think Azura shall stay long in the same room with me, I would form your questions beforehand. Perhaps a ribcage's worth, and no more.
## Vehk (03/02/04):

If I may put forward a question of my own to the dread lord Azura:

Should I be found guilty of past transgressions in a world that no longer lives, how might I find my absolution?
## God_of_Worms (03/02/04)

Ah, yes, a mortal's witch-hunt. It has been quite some time since petty souls have lured my curiosity into such a petty (or is it?!) event. A riddled tongue versus the weak? Please do consider me a worthy accountant of this affair.

By all means, please do continue on with your bandwagon folly. Mind not the shadowy figure amidst your presence.
## Allerleirauh (03/02/04):

(Do others hear a voice from beyond the grave? I am troubled by it... often lying spirits thus speak in the voices of the dead.)

Noble B, I confess I had not thought of the Dreaming Cave. But if my memory serves, Sotha Sil did not escape unscathed from his encounter there. I would not freight your soul in such a way while another alternative lies open to us. And perhaps we shall have better answers from Azura here than in her own realm.

Earlier I suggested three categories of crimes: against Nerevar, against the gods, and against the people of Morrowind. It seems to me that Azura may well shed light on the first two. And that surely this court has enough authority to decide the matter of the third without supernatural help.

So: many have spoken of the murder of Nerevar. This seems to me the least of Vivec's many crimes. Shall we speak also of broken oaths, and oaths sworn falsely? Of stolen divinity, and worship diverted?
## Vehk (03/02/04):
Allerleirauh: So: many have spoken of the murder of Nerevar. This seems to me the least of Vivec's many crimes. Shall we speak also of broken oaths, and oaths sworn falsely? Of stolen divinity, and worship diverted?

If you do this, I beg the court that I might call a soul to my defense.

Governing my sweet Vvardenfell, for me, displayed itself mainly as fashion-orgies, insect wrestling, and chocolate parades.

I would have someone who knew the more pedestrian aspects of my supervisory benevolence to represent me here.
## Allerleirauh (03/02/04):

Well, Vehk, who would you call? The business of this court is speech, not silence.
## Vehk (03/02/04):

Oh, I doubt you will have to worry there, little snowskin, I think he is the most talkative Corner I know. And fortunately more ready to attend than Azura, for he heeds dates seldom.

Mercy, you've shown me little. And so it is with no little irony that I call SHEOGORATH to defend me on the matters of my state!

Bitter spear of mercy, meet your mirror.
## Sheogorath (03/02/04):

Hello. I was having drinks with my two best friends, Bad Bad Bad Bad Blad and myself, when I received the subpoena. I came as quickly as I could, though in a non-linear fashion, so you will have to forgive my lack of lines.

From a legal point-of-view, lawsuits against deities aren't actually very uncommon, though many choose to settle out of court or simply pay the fine, which is seldom more than five gold. I once had a bout of self-doubt, was judged guilty of heresy, and had to choose between death by stoning or by inhalation next to an orc. I chose the baked chicken.

At first I thought I was being summoned as a character witness, and I can assure you I've seen lower-cases, or to give my expert testimony of the fascinating psychological aspects of this trial. It's something I've given a lot of serious thought to. To quote dear Almalexia, "People think I'm crazy just because of all the weird things I say while fondling wombats."

But while I'm not quite mad enough to be a judge, I think I'm well-qualified to be a barrister for the defense. Now, remind me: which is better, guilty or not guilty?
## Sheogorath (03/02/04):

You call it nonsense, and you're right – there is no sense that can touch madness. Therefore madness is not physical. And therefore, madness is immaterial.
## Vehk (03/02/04):

Ah, beloved enemy, "symbol affixed on things unborn, seen from the mercy seat without love to run or rename," it seems I am to question you. Strange. Perhaps the Tribunal fears your eight-legged visage.

So: the governance of Morrowind during my tenure: did you like or dislike?
## Sheogorath (03/02/04):

Would you rephrase that as "So: the governance of Morrowind during my tenure: did you dislike or like?"

Regardless, I liked my displeasure in it.

I'd like to object to what I just said! Witness is leading the witless!
## Vehk (03/02/04):

A popular book in Morrowind compares me to my Anticipation, Mephala, thusly:

"[The] explicit presentation of Vivec the Guardian God-King and Warrior-Poet is the one most accessible and familiar to Westerners. However, it is important to remember that Vivec is also known to the Dunmer as the transcendent evolution of the daedra that anticipated him, Black Hands Mephala, a foundation figure of the earliest Chimer. This darker side of Vivec does not appear in the popular literature and liturgy, but is instinctively understood and accepted by the Dunmer as an integral part of Vivec's divine aspect."

As part of the fraternity that you share with my fore-self Mephala, would you or would you not say that my replacement of Hir (in Veloth, at least) was hardly noticed by the common people?

Moreso, wouldn't you say that I did not replace Mephala so much as become Hir living celebrant?
## God_of_Worms (03/02/04)
Girai_Harkaanius: By the way, what cause does the God of Worms have to attend this merry assemblage? We will not have any more trouble caused here then already done.

I assure you, my attendance is hardly a summoning. A Dark Raven fed unto me the tidings of a grand accusation in The East. Upon hearing detail of this most exciting event, I decided that my absence would be quite a personal regret. I would just as soon witness the lame spawn of dragons mate than miss this.
## Sheogorath (03/02/04):

In order to avoid confusion, may I take the first part of the last question last?
Vehk: As part of the fraternity that you share with my fore-self Mephala, would you or would you not say that my replacement of Hir (in Veloth, at least) was hardly noticed by the common people?

Hir? You mean, Hircine? We don't call Him Hir Here, Ha. In fact, we never call Hircine at all, because he's naked and smells quite a lot, and he never takes off his antlers in the presence of ladies. Now, Mephala is a different kettle of cheese. I've never spoken to a common person – they are far too rare – but I understand that many of them prefer you to Mephala, and being devoured by slaughterfish to both of you.
Vehk: Moreso, wouldn't you say that I did not replace Mephala so much as become her living celebrant?

Absolutely, I would say that, but only because I don't know what that means. Could you clarify your position, so I can confuse you?
## Vehk (03/02/04):
Sheogorath: Absolutely, I would say that

Very good. I would rest my case on the matter of worship diverted. What says the Council?
## Vehk (03/02/04):
God_of_Worms: I sense much disorder in this trial of ego versus jealousy.

As you go up, so do I come down. I welcome thee, Mannimarco, to this jury of dreams. I foresee you may have the last word here, after Azura comes with her moon-slain reprieve.
## Nigedo (03/02/04):

Vehk, you may recognise Mannimarco, but most here do not. We are not so familiar with these notables as you and so it would be easy for us to slide into confusion with regard to their identities.

As appointed Tribune, I therefore call for one who can identify such notable observers and witnesses as may be unknown amongst us, to announce the legitimate presence of such individuals, that they are indeed who they claim to be.

Is there any present who can and will perform this duty?
## Divayth Fyr the Psijic (03/02/04)
Nigedo: Is there any present who can and will perform this duty?

I will, only for the sake of the preceeding, recognise these beings as such, Mannimarco, and the One, Sheogorath. They are, unmistakingly, who they say they are.

I do sense a strange representation with their presence at this assembly. It is not likely that the King of Worms would dwell among mortals without some sort of trickery in his shadow.

My OLD friend, Vehk, of the late ALMSIVI, what scheme have you devised to draw forth such a stagnant crowd? You can not hide your intensions behind that wicked smile you wear forever.
## Nigedo (03/02/04)

Thank you for your assistance Lord Fyr.

I will now hope that Sheogorath will honour me with an answer to my question.
## Vehk (03/02/04):
Nigedo: Thank you for your assistance Lord Fyr. I will now hope that Sheogorath will honour me with an answer to my question.

Master, I sense that the Mad One has left for the moment. It may have had something to do with the presence of Lord Fyr, who is one of the few adepts I know that can send the jackanape-god into tears. May I suggest that your question be answered by none other than your fellow Tribune, Hasphat Antabolis, on the morrow? If any here could speak with authority about my stewardship of the people of Vvardenfell, I admit that it is the Hlaalu bedhandler asleep at your side...
## Nigedo (03/02/04)

Allerleirauh,

Have you agreed to the skilled summoner that was privately proposed earlier for the summoning of Azura?

I know that Antabolis is in support.
## Allerleirauh (03/02/04):

Yes, Nigedo.

Ainoryl informs me he is familiar with the summoning procedure. So be it.
## Ainoryl (03/02/04):

[Steps out from the mob]

This is correct, I am familiar with the invocation of the Mother Soul.

In this act I will require four gifts, worthy of Azura:

-The artifact Azura's Star. It rests in Vvardenfell.

-The antlers of the beast King Dead Wolf-Deer. The beast was last seen in High Rock.

-A single ringlet from the Wraithmail of Alandro-Sul, son of Azura. It may be found in Vvardenfell.

-The last gift to the Goddess of Dusk and Dawn may be found here. A shadow stripped, willingly and permanently, from one who watches this trial.

Any who would aid in the gathering of these items, step forward. Please pardon my interruption of the proceedings. You have twenty days.
## Vehk (03/02/04):

Ainoryl, is it? A fine choice, if a bit babe-before-wolves. And I see this is his first True summoning, as he's taking the wisest of precautions. Smart boy. Let it be known, then, that he is blessed, and that no man or mer may hinder him on pain of Mark.
## LDones (03/02/04):

Oh my. It seems I am in high company. Lord Mannimarco, if you can hear me, may I say it is an honor to be in your... presence, as it were. I have numerous acquaintances who shall nearly die with envy at the mention that I have attended Council under your view. Your mortal work is most influential - if unorthodox. I appear to have missed Lord Fyr and the old Skooma Cat this time around, but I shall make the most of our next meeting, whenever it may be.

Master Ainoryl, a heavy thanks on behalf of this Council for your services as an impartial priest. I am sure you may be trusted with the burden of discretion that these proceedings necessitate. Now, the matter of obtaining the necessary summoning materials within twenty days...

Azura's Star – Some more illuminated companions of mine (Great Librarian Xanathar knows of whom I speak, though I would beg of him to let them remain anonymous) recently let slip that the Nerevarine had hold of Azura's Star while in their company, and was heading toward the Nordic island of Solstheim with it in possession, shortly before all that business with the moons turning red those months back. Whether it was left somewhere on Vvardenfell for safe-keeping or was left on Solstheim since our dear Nerevarine went incognito is a mystery. I would recommend someone from the Council be dispatched to the island of Solstheim to speak w/ the Nordic peoples there. The former leaders of various factions here on Vvardenfell should also likely be consulted. Hm. Archmage Trebonius and Lord Venim of Redoran were recently deceased, weren't they? Is Percius Mercius still about? Hasphat Antabolis might have heard of something. I shall ask him...

I have no ideas whatsoever regarding the whereabouts of the Antlers or the ringlet of Wraithmail.

As for the stripping of a shadow, I have given it a great deal of thought, and am willing to volunteer mine for the process. This is no small sacrifice for an outlander, I know – and the potential consequences of being faced with all manner of wraiths or some bloody evil incarnation of my own shadow at some future time as a result are palpable, believe me – but the unknown waits to be pierced for only so long – and it is not often that one is called upon to give a gift to a god on behalf of the guilt or innocence of another. I ask only that I be allowed my final days with my shadow in peace until the 20th of First Seed, so I might make the necessary... spiritual preparations.

If one more worthy or more zealous than myself should step forward, then by all means I shall accede. But I am an observer and an active participant in this Trial and have made my decision known.

In the meantime, the questions to be posed to both Azura and Lord Vehk's unusual defense should be further explored and refined, I think.

--Louis D'Onus Breton-Born Dunmer of Dubious Distinction
## Ainoryl (03/02/04):

I give thanks to you, Louis D'Onus, for the information you bring to light. Any who would aid in the recovery of Azura's star, might make best of their time in the direction of Solstheim, tracing the footsteps of the Nerevarine.

Let it also be noted that Louis D'Onus has offered his shadow willingly in the invocation of Azura. Brave, and noble I say. Fear not for your peace, it will remain unbroken until the twentieth.
## Vehk (03/02/04):

A splendid hall, Maiden Teggers. This will please her Ladyship, as house and House, where it shall be known for eternity as that place where Vehk's final doom came to him at last. GHARTOK PADHOME AI. Now, sweet maiden, might you wish to recline with me and learn the belly-magics of the Star-wounded East? If you become lonely, I know of a new Tribunal I can command to join us, bringing grapes.
## Teggers (03/02/04):

My dear Vehk,

As flattered as I truly am by the attentions of one so... experienced as yourself, I fear that my body would adapt to these belly-magics much better than would be good for my mind. Tempting as your offer may be, I currently have no desire to dwell in Sheogorath's shadow.
## Vehk (03/02/04):

Ah well, entertaining myself, it seems. It ✶is✶ why I grew all these extra limbs...
## God_of_Worms (03/03/04)

These preceedings are surely bones in the belly of the beast. It is not my place to speak, but I must declare the prosecuting party, incompetent, by my standards of preparation. I am troubled by the accusations brought upon your defendant while there is no worthwhile evidence at present.

Witnesses?

Statements?

Blood of old?

Shadows now lost in the Giver of Life?

I move that this, "Court", present more than simple rumor and opinionated assumption for this lynching to continue. The summoning of "The Great Mother" ✶sneer✶ is hardly justification to extend this ludicrous venture. Perhaps the "Courts" would prefer to journey to the Times of Past and revive all their necessary evidence?

Justice. A word the weak gave birth to so others may give them security, well being. and self pleasure. Be done with this mockery of your "Criminal System". Lord Vivec is simply not here for your pleasure.... or is he. I refrain from answering that. ✶grin✶
## God_of_Worms (03/03/04)
Nigedo: Please... tell us who you would call or what methods you would enact for the proper appropriation of:-

You ask methods of me? I am not witness. I am not council. I merely stand as audience to amuse myself with these preceedings. It is you and your colleagues who have taken on the "heroics" of judgment. I have my methods. Oh yes, I most certainly do. Of course, I am not judge nor council here, so it is only just, that I share not my "modus operandi".

Witnesses? I see none.... living.

Statements? I've heard none.... from the living.

Blood of old? Oh yes, it is MUCH "speculated".

Shadows now lost in the Giver of Life? With the passing of time, mysteries evolve. As do stories, grow and twist in form. With the birth of every new dawn, a new chapter is housed in every book of history. Just who is it that grants life to these chapters? Those who "hear tale" of this, "History".
Nigedo: It clearly appears to have escaped your attention that Vehk himself has demanded this trial be continued and set both the prosecution and the order of the procedure. Take this up with him.

Ah, alas, I need not ask the one standing trial. I understand all too clearly why he has allowed such audience. In time, I foresee you WILL learn the truth. I dare say, that it is not Lord Vehk who stands on trial. What punishment could you mere mortals hand down on Lord Vehk had you found him guilty of crime? ✶laugh✶

Yes, the real question here is, who is on trial? Lord Vehk is quite cunning. Your audience feeds his hunger. I simply wonder if your ability to keep him "fed" is enough to subdue the Wrath of Outer Intention.

Know this mortals....

You stir the very coals that keep the Millenia Dragon in slumber. Your meddling may be just the action the Dragon wants to awaken from it's lengthy nightmare.

✶turns and bows to Lord Vehk✶

✶grin✶
## Nigedo (03/03/04)

Again, Mannimarco, I thank you for your attempt to edify this court.

However, as esteemed Allerleirauh has clearly explained, we the Tribunal of this trial are appointed by Vehk under his direction to damn him as we may.

If, in trying Vehk, we may be guilty of a crime ourselves as you suppose, then it is only by Vehk's express command.

Ergo, it is Vehk's crime and we shall add it to the list.

Good day to you.
## God_of_Worms (03/03/04)
LDones: Your patience will be rewarded with a spectacle worth the beholding, I hope...

Indeed, it will. Most assurdly, I await the payoff. Mark my words, the reward will be one long awaited, for reasons you have not begun to realise. I certainly have my reasons for attending this "spectacle". Oh, how I ✶DO✶ show great gratitude for this fine council in handling Lord Vehk's bidding. ✶grin✶
## Vehk (03/03/04):

Mannimarco, my gentle, please mind your maggot-tongue. I remind you that the last time you antagonized a Tribunal, it resulted in more restless dead than even the sea would accept. Know that the structure of this trial is unconventional to the eyes of the West and yet still older in tradition than both our divinities, newly acquired or relinquised. I am glad thou art here, and though I suspect it bodes ill I yet beg thee to stay, but finally in the manner of the lord-as-guest. Pray let not that illness spread the more by the inquities of an unmannered mouth.
## God_of_Worms (03/03/04)
Nigedo: However, as esteemed Allerleirauh has clearly explained, we the Tribunal of this trial are appointed by Vehk under his direction to damn him as we may.

Oh yes yes yes, indeed you are. Lord Vehk would only appoint the most highly regarded to judge him "justly". I have no doubt in my mind that the "Tribunal's" task at hand will be a necessity for the future of a great many of us.
Nigedo: If, in trying Vehk, we may be guilty of a crime ourselves as you suppose, then it is only by Vehk's express command.

I suppose? On the contrary! Your duty of trying Lord Vehk for crimes is quite pleasing. I am "quite" sure that this Gathering will finally bring resolve to many troubled minds.
Nigedo: Ergo, it is Vehk's crime and we shall add it to the list.

I would expect no less from such a fine collective of Prosecuters.
Nigedo: Good day to you.

Soon enough. ✶grin✶
## God_of_Worms (03/03/04)
Vehk: Mannimarco, my gentle, please mind your maggot-tongue.

✶bowing and backing away✶

As you wish Lord Vehk. I fare thee well. May the Tribunal judge you with kindness and understanding. My services and council shall remain available should they come in need. I await the Tribunal's decision, in due time.

✶grin✶
## Ainoryl (03/04/04)

At the request of Louis D'Onus, I give you the little information I have on the elusive beast mentioned...

King Dead Wolf-Deer is one of the surviving monster-mer of the Wild Hunt that slew Borgas of Skyrim. He is thus one of the oldest creatures in Tamriel, and therefore no trifle. That he exists still to haunt High Rock thousands of years later speaks to the danger of retrieving his antler-crown.

Good luck.
## Ainoryl (03/04/04)

Dear Solyn,

Your assistance to those seeking the Wraithmail is greatly appreciated, but to my knowledge, your assumption that the Wraithmail is solely bonemould may be misleading. If you will take for example the armor of the late Almalexia's personal guard, and the other various High Ordinators of Mournhold. I assure you, while perhaps a rarity, chain has been used in the east in a variety of ways. While I may be incorrect, do not rule out the probability of the armor being comprised of chain or rings.

Also,

I worry for our brave friends, Mafafu and Stri'ker, who hunt the antlers of the beast. May we all hope for their safe return.
## Ainoryl (03/04/04)

I too have thought on the relationship between the three artifacts mentioned in The Five Songs of King Wulfharth, and the "Wraith Mail." It seems entirely likely that this is in fact referring to the "Wraithguard." Two things: The above book is known to contain several inconsistencies. Also, as I am certain Solyn can verify, the Wraithmail specific to Alando-Sul has merit. Perhaps "Wraithguard" was part of this wraithmail, is unrelated, or simply is the wraithmail. I will gather more information on the subject.
## Allerleirauh (03/05/04):

Vivec. Because of you, one who was a gifted scholar and a noble friend is dead. Add this to this list of your crimes.

We cannot decently continue this trial until we have given the dead the proper ceremonies. Until the body of our fallen friend is returned to us, these proceedings are suspended.

Hail, Stri'Ker! Let all who gather here speak his praises.
## Ainoryl (03/05/04)

The air in this hall seems to have grown heavy with the weight of this loss. Perhaps the gravity of this trial is being wholly realised now, for the first time since its commencement. I cannot properly express the grief I feel in Stri'Kers' passing, or the guilt I acknowledge. But grief and guilt may fill this hall, and not without cause. Perhaps now, with the loss of our brave and honorable friend, we re-evaluate the consequences of an event such as this. What costs can there be, in a trial of the gods?

The respect and awe I have for Stri'Ker and Mafafu, individuals willing to give their life in the persuit of knowledge and (perhaps) justice, is vast. But I must warn you all of the days to come. Know what it is that you meddle in, this gods' game. The blood on our hands, is not the last this hall will see. Are all of you willing to pay the price for truth?

May our friend Stri'Ker be forever remembered as a soul with such dedication and bravery, that he would give himself utterly for that which he held most dear. Can there possibly be a greater display of honor?
## Vehk (03/05/04):

I...cannot express my grief. Nor can I sing great praise until those...those wicked grey wings have flown more south. Blessed are you, brave khajiit, blessed even as now damned. For cruel mercy is right, I ✶did✶ damn you. I cannot express...I now fold myself into the nil, to know a bit of where you are, and if I were to give myself new eyes, for I could give myself new eyes, I would still be blind with tears. Grief is my stillborn sibling. I cannot abide it. I will return with great song.
God_of_Worms (03/05/04)
Allerleirauh: Vivec. Because of you, one who was a gifted scholar and a noble friend is dead. Add this to this list of your crimes.

Ah yes, add another crime to Lord Vehk's countless wrong doings. Why, was it not Lord Vehk who sent this warrior cat out to do the Tribunal's bidding afterall? I do hope this Tribunal finds apt time after judgement to be tried for their own guiltless mistakes. Perhaps then the Tribunal can accept the guilt in sending a beast off to his death, committed to a task they had dealt him with. It is far too easy to blame another when you have not ownership of your own guilty conscience.

And perhaps in death, this Sti'Ker will realise what a stubborn tool he was to accept this Tribunal's quest. I shall let him know that this Tribunal can not admit their guilt to his death, but instead, would pass it on to Lord Vehk. For then, the true aura of this Tribunal, his "friends", shall be known to him, for him to ponder for his eternity in death.

I shall give leave now, and allow this Tribunal to continue to manufacture more crimes for Lord Vehk. I shall carry with me your message of Sorrow and Love for your thick coated pet and companion.
## Vehk (03/05/04):

I apologise for the delay in verification of the ringlet. The process is taking longer than expected. I thank you all for your effort and patience, and will return when I am sure of the items authenticity.
## Sheogorath (03/06/04):

What a recipe.

Have you tried reading the complete catalog of the University of Gwilym, while simultaneously combing your hair with a slab of bacon and slaying a flea with a battle axe?

Couldn't hurt.
## Ainoryl (03/07/04)

I am making progress. The item resists many of my attempts to read into it's true nature. This however leads me to believe that it is indeed more than a trinket. I am certain that I will have an answer for you all shortly.

I am very eager to see the return of Azura's Star. I wish you a speedy, and safe trip back to the hall Master Lugagius.
## Ainoryl (03/08/04)

How do you suppose that because a once-god is now mortal, it is thus your 'right' to put him to trial? Vehk is on trial because he wills it. I think it would be wise to keep that in mind.

I do however agree, we should hold fast to our goal. I commend everyone in this hall in their efforts, especially our Tribunal, and all those who have risked and sacrificed to recover the items for Hogithum.

I am still busy at work on the ringlet. The work should be done very soon.
## God_of_Worms (03/09/04)
Ainoryl: How do you suppose that because a once-god is now mortal, it is thus your 'right' to put him to trial? Vehk is on trial because he wills it. I think it would be wise to keep that in mind.

But of course my good Ainoryl. Lork Vehk wills those who would once follow and honor him, to justly judge him and innevitably condemn him. Given his past deeds do indeed prove him to be the barbaric overlord he is being tried for, it is only right that this Tribunal posts a great punishment upon him. For, the mortal leaders of this existence will see it fit to condemn such a man, but an even greater man such as Lord Vehk? I do await The Lady of The Mortal's "Truth", Azura, to enlighten this perhaps, jaded congregation. Do understand, if the Tribunal finds Lord Vehk to be a blackened light among brightness, I, the King of Worms shall applaud thee for carrying out the task at hand. If Lord Vehk prevails, I can only begin to foresee the smile he shall wear for eternity.

And do know, my good Tribunal, no harm has or will come to your companion, Stri'Ker. For, his spirit is far too noble for my tamperings. His soul rests upon a pedastal of brilliance, of which not even the likes of the King of Worms can gaze upon. I am stunned that many would have me as a "thief" of souls.

The verification of the ringlet shall be so:

Harold Trontskii must place the ringlet in his mouth. Almost immediately he shall feel heavy, yet light-headed. And a Voice will speak through him, carrying a simple yet beautiful yet powerful message from the greyness between times.

If the ringlet is true, Master Vehk shall hear his lover-liar Alandro Sul in this Voice, and this part of our quest is done, and much glory will there be in the name of Harold Trontskii.

If the ringlet is false, the speaker will die.

Beware, Harold Trontskii, lest the Voice falter.

"I would only say... let no mortal man presume to judge this immortal Vivec. Such things as these eyes have seen -- such things as MY eyes have seen -- these things are weighed in the hands of the Gods.

"That Vivec has chosen to place himself in the hands of the Law pleases us, and does him honor. His acknowledgement and acceptance of the Law brings him within our countenance. We neither smile, nor frown, but say... let Justice and the Law be done."

✶The Emperor of Tamriel then leaves, and those present that are his agents, willing or otherwise, strive not to stare too hard, lest they give up their identities.

I would also like to say, thank you, to all assembled. It was no small task to recover these items. I was extremely impressed, and a bit surprised, at how quickly so many offered their aid and support.

Though I doubt the star is counterfeit, still, I must study it to be certain of its authenticity. I will return.

## Gosleigh (03/11/04)

My lord Celarus begs your pardon for his abrupt departure. I know he has been trying to speak with the Emperor for some time now about several extremely urgent matters, and he didn't have the time to give his farewells to this august company.

I haven't been to the eastern provinces in years, but I have a very good friend in Morrowind who used to keep me up to date with your practices here. I understand it that a God has fallen and we are here to stab at him while he lies bleeding?
## Gosleigh (03/12/04)

Oh, by Iachesis, what have I got myself in to? I thought this was a hall of philosophers and legislators, not curses and madmen ...
## Gosleigh (03/12/04)

I'm sorry I can't be help in this situation. Celarus could perhaps exorcise the poor man, or set wards against Sheogorath's indirect influence (his direct influence, of couse, is out of the question – Daedra Princes do as they will), but I'm afraid I'm useless. I don't think my master knew quite how dangerous this place is ... else surely he wouldn't have requested me to stay behind while he talked to the Emperor ...

And forgive my bluntness on the trial of Vehk. From my own point-of-view, if there was an opportunity to try Molag Bal or Vaernima or, of course, Sheogorath, I think all would be found guilty. I don't think Vivec is far from that notorious fellowship.

I also put it to you that he was never a very great poet.
## Vehk (03/12/04)
B: How is it that you spoke so seldom with your sister and brother, Ayem and Seht, allowing Ayem certainly and Seht perhaps to fall into madness at such a critical hour as that of the loss of the Tribunal's godhood? Any mere mortal would have devoted more care to his family.... your inertia surprises me.

Is this a crime, Mercy? Or merely a stark variation that causes you a personal anguish, this difference in the kinship of snowmen and their devils? To admit I am mortal does not admit that I am a man. I am still hero, and weapon of the Dunmer, and what you might read as inertia is most certainly just the absence of war.

In any case, I answer this only because you will it of me. I did not speak to either Ayem or Seht enough before their death because...well, because, mortal or divine, that is the way it always is.
## Vehk (03/12/04)

The Tribunal gloriously usurped the worship of our Anticipations, as was foretold in the words of Veloth. That you would categorize this as a crime is confusing to me. Perhaps you wish to know true history so that you will not go longer unlearned.

Providence. That is my plea regarding my replacement of the Black Hands Mephala.

I spoke of this in an earlier life, but earlier than myself were Ayem and Seht. They had supplanted in the orbit of the Chimeri soul those Daedra that predated them, Boethiah and Azura respectively. None of us did this out of criminal intent. Rather, as I have said, these beings were our Anticipations in the truest sense, the fore-images of the gods that would come for Morrowind. We hold the original Triune in honor as the bringers of knowledge and culture, and difference, and revere them as the harbingers of the glory of ALMSIVI. And never did we question their divinities or remove them from our holy books.

But as I once spoke of the Rainmaker, the needs of the people change, and those that provide guidance to them must also change. While it may seem strange to imply that our fore-images, being Daedra, were adverse to change, they were, and they are. In this they are very alike to the Aedra in their fundaments. While born of Padhome, they are of too much ego to give up their realms entirely, especially for altruism, which is perhaps what they most hate.

And so from their basis did we spring, called to heaven by violence, our people throwing our mantles to us across stars, and across time, and magic and dream, and here we remain.

Even those of us who are dead. Or are destined to die.
Gosleigh (03/12/04)
B: Goleigh, I see Loremaster Celarus has sent you to us. How good to see another Psijic in this Hall. I don't believe we have been officially introduced, but perhaps you have heard of me.

I must confess. A friend of mine "accidentally" came across some of your letters of correspondence with a man named Xal. It just so happens that my name was mentioned in a couple of them. Of course, I didn't read every word. That wouldn't have been right of me to do.
Well now, imagine my embarrassment now that I have to confess this to you to your face, but please do not harbor any ill will towards me, good fellow. Surely, this place is big enough for the both of us.

All in the past, B. I didn't realize our correspondence had been made public until arriving on these shores ... thankfully, the most secret of the letters have never surfaced ... nor has Xal for that matter ...
## Gosleigh (03/12/04)

Might I suggest that we keep from mentioning His name too much in these proceedings? He is distracted now, but every time his name is mentioned, it is a quiet calling to him. Perhaps "The Mad God" or "The Prince Of Madness" would be useful synonyms.
## Ainoryl (03/12/04)

Well... I think some clarifications should be made, and some developments made known.

First, my dear Nazz, I wasn't aware that you were so experienced with the summoning of a prince of oblivion. Perhaps, if you have the time, you could enlighten me on some of the finer points I may have missed out on. I might even let you greet her, if you're so inclined. I'm sure she'll be very pleased to be in the hall. Do let me know.

In all honesty, the summoning still is uncertain. Even with all the preperations and offerings in the world, Azura will most likely be very unhappy. Please keep this in mind when you prepare questions for her. Ask nicely.

As for the Star.. It is with complete certainty, Azura's Star. As for what soul is inside the gem, I can only guess. Yes, it is powerful. No, your minds and souls are not in danger. Draco, you may keep your box, but thank you, and please stop following me, you're starting to make me a bit nervous.

I am working with the tribunal, in order to identify what sort of entity is within the gem. I do not wish to disturb the discussions going on too greatly, but I may be calling upon the hall for aid again before long.
## Vehk (03/12/04)
Vehk: The Tribunal gloriously usurped the worship of our Anticipations, as was foretold in the words of Veloth.
Nigedo: What words, dear Vehk? Would you please quote the prophet rather than merely allude to his affirmation. And please provide a corroboratory source or I will deem this to be inadmissable as evidence.

I would refer you to any number of passages within our Heirographa, whose corroborators would be your own ancestors.

But I will not be drawn into a trial better fit to take place in Holamayan. However

What a wondrous love it is To bind two souls in faith
Nigedo: ...please explain clearly how you can describe the apotheoses of Ayem and Seht as having taken place ✶earlier✶ than your own.

The account of Vivec's birth in this our new world is well known, and therefore this is answered. This son of a netchiman's wife would only say here, however, that proposing to this court that he had always been is not the same thing as saying he had no beginning.
Vehk: None of us did this out of criminal intent.
Nigedo: That is for this Court to decide Vehk.

Point.
Nigedo: In a parallel Time [the Good Daedra] were the sole divine stewards of the Chimer. In the Time that healed itself to fit your new god-images, they were reduced to mere 'anticipations' of the divine stewards of the Dunmer.

We shall never know what may have eventually occurred in the world before now, so I am not sure how to defend myself against this implication.
Nigedo: The Chimer themselves became a people accordingly tainted by the very crime that sundered the Time of their own fore-images and reforged them as the unwitting inheritors of the Dunmeri curse. What do you say to this?

I say nothing to this as it stands, for I do not agree with the question. A non-event at an unravelled place qualifies as a conundrum, but not a crime.
Nigedo: Tell us then what new needs of the Chimer sanctioned their transformation into the Dunmer, the replacement of the most key figures of their pantheon and the desolation of their homeland into an ashen wasteland.

To answer in reverse: The land of Veloth was as ash before the Temple. The key figures in the pantheon had outgrown their usefulness. The needs that necessitated the change from Chimer to Dunmer were new measures of defense against the infidel, cultural reforms in house, vault, and social services, and the spiritual advancement of the people and their priests.
Nigedo: While born of Padhome, [Daedra] are of too much ego to give up their realms entirely, especially for altruism, which is perhaps what they most hate. This is mere conjecture on your part. I see no evidence to support your opinion of the Daedra.

Having had Daedra as friends, mentors, lovers, husbands, wives, servants, confidants, children, hosts, guests, collaborators, and, for a time, countrymer, I move this to...informed conjecture.
Nigedo: Without the misuse of the Heart of the Missing God, you would not have existed as Vivec of ALMSIVI. The subsequent timelessness of the spiritual needs of a people who also would not have existed in their present state but for your mortal act, are entirely irrelevant. If you believe this to be incorrect then, please, convince us otherwise.

I ask the court, without facetious intent, to rephrase this as a question I can understand, and beg their indulgence to the unprofound.
## Vehk (03/12/04)
Allerleirauh: If a disaster is coming, and you know it, and yet do not tell those in its path, you are a traitor, are you not?

Or a coward. I am neither.

I predicted harm to herself and others, not a disaster. And, as Ayem had always been First Face, it would have been indecent to ask her plans without invitation. My only crime here is not offering what consolation a brother should have to his suffering sister.

I should also say that as ALMSIVI, I knew below knowing some of the things felt, and desired, and contemplated in madness. Therefore any crimes of Ayem I put forth to the court to regard as my own.
Allerleirauh: ...you did not remove the Anticipations from your holy books. But you did remove four other Daedra, equally worshipped under the Prophet Veloth. Their worship was forbidden because they failed to bow to you. What of them?

You are mistaken here. Many Temple writings discuss the Corners at length, including the guidance, admittedly hidden for the worthy, to worship the Four in their aspect as Veloth's testers.

For their own safety, the lay people were forbidden to worship the Corners, but instructed to still regard them as holy.

And I can only forward that ALMSIVI did not challenge madness, destruction, corruption, and sickness because they did not bow to us...but rather on the merits they exhibited even before our arrival.
Allerleirauh: This has a very odd sound, from your lips... are you accusing yourself of altruism?

That crime is Ayem's, Blessed Be Her Holy Name.
## Vehk (03/13/04)
Vehk: I would refer you to any number of passages within our Heirographa
Nigedo: In the complete absence of reliable evidence, I beg this Court to disregard the notion that Vehk has proposed, towhit: his apotheosis was both foretold and therefore sanctioned by the Chimeri prophet Veloth.

Careful. You are barely staying within the whole of the rules, and willfully breaking the ones you know.
Nigedo: ...please explain clearly how you can describe the apotheoses of Ayem and Seht as having taken place ✶earlier✶ than your own.
Nigedo: I challenge within this the subtle implication that you were a younger and, by extension, a more innocent party than your triune co-conspirers, whether as mortals or immortals. Is this, in fact, something you hope to persuade the Court to accept? Or should we rather disregard that implication as unintended?

And the Chancellor ran as milk...

I cannot be caught, my dear Nigedo. But, yes, if you are offering, if the dawn exists before its rise, then it is guilty of light. I take their offenses as my own.
Nigedo: ...nor shall we know whether the three guardian daedra of the Chimer were sufficient to their role, since that role was peremptorily denied them by your actions. Correct?

Inasmuch as we shall never know, yes, we shall never know.
Nigedo: In steps then... Following treason and the breaking of a sacred oath, you stole a bridge to godhood.

I defer to the summoning of Azura and the one, true Nerevar to the allegations of treason and oath-breaking.

But I gladly—no, delightfully—admit to stealing my bridge to godhood! Let the court record I would do it again and again. Moreover, I've left instructions for others to do the same, and look more pretty than I did doing it!
Nigedo: The Chimer people were transformed into the Dunmer as a result of the actions of you and your confederates as mortals.

I will assume you mean their physical change here, not the stronger but more subtle fundamental change. The second I will gladly—no, delightfully—take credit for.

For the former, no, I cannot say they were transformed as a result of the actions ALMSIVI took while mortal.
Nigedo: By owning the Dunmer people into existence, to replace the Chimer who were bound to the gods you surplanted [sic], you brought upon these innocents the curse of your mortal actions. Is ✶this✶ a fair assessment or no?

Ha ha ha. For one, I must again ask this court not to apply more conventional opinions to these matters, to whit: the first Chimer to admit he was innocent from the start never made the journey to Veloth at all.

For seconds, what is this predilection for making this alleged 'curse' synonymous with our physical change? How are we worse from before? In fact, I like the particular look so much I wear it myself half the time.
Nigedo: I would say that this supports the view that the first major eruption of Vvardenfell contributed to the destruction of a large portion of the heartland of Resdayn and did not take place until the Dwemeri people were well established.

I agree with this, and applaud your scholarship. Major eruption or no, Veloth was still full of ash prior to the Temple. I would quote myself, but fear for appearances.
Nigedo: You disturbed the powers within the Heart and those powers swelled up and broke out upon the resting place of the Heart, causing Resdayn to become the ashen wasteland it is now.

I refute the phrasing 'swelled up and broke out upon...'

What we did was far more calculated, precise in accordance with laws set down in ancient days. Unfortunately I cannot present you with the drafts of Magnus we worked from. I love you too much.
Vehk: The needs that necessitated the change from Chimer to Dunmer were new measures of defense against the infidel, cultural reforms in house, vault, and social services, and the spiritual advancement of the people and their priests.
Nigedo: Very vague Master Vehk. Perhaps you would care to elucidate?

On four thousand years of my regime? Could you even last that long, even if I taught you how to breathe water?

I only point to four thousand years of peace and glory and holiness to speak on its own behalf.
## Vehk (03/13/04)
Nigedo: "And so from their basis did we spring, called to heaven by violence, our people throwing our mantles to us across stars, and across time, and magic and dream, and here we remain." Here, you suggest that your godly mantle, and by this I understand you to mean your people's spiritual mandate, was gifted to you across the displacement between the worlds that existed 'before' and 'after' your ascent to godhood.

Not exactly, but good enough for the purposes of your next argument.
Nigedo: But this is nonsense. Indeed, there was a cause and effect in the creation of your relationship with the Dunmer and it was not instigated by the Dunmer people. It was instigated by your mortal actions. The people were changed to fit your need as a god not the other way around as you would apparently have this Court believe.

Wait, are we putting the universe on trial here? We will need a bigger hall.
Nigedo: Had you not tampered with the Heart of Lorkhan, do you suppose that the Chimer would have transformed themselves?

I answer this in this way: Without the Heart, the glory of the Dunmer would have never grown as radiant.

I question this in this way: Is there a point, Master?
## Gosleigh (03/14/04)

Another legal point worth mentioning, and I quote from Anchivius's "Legal Basics":
The Tamriel legal system has its basis in the civilized, reasonable credo uttered by the prophet Marukh in the first era: "All are guilty until they have proven themselves innocent." Were truer word ever spoke?

Thus, it is not enough that Vehk offers response to our questions. He must prove himself guiltless beyond a reasonable doubt.
## Gosleigh (03/14/04)

You intend to bring forth the shade of Dagoth Ur? Is that safe?

... Oh dear, oh dear, what have I gotten myself into? ... I shouldn't be here ... Perhaps, I can call Celarus back to take my place ...
## Vehk (03/14/04)

Yes, Aquinatus, do back off. Your twisting of definitions is not only wrongheaded, but unlovely. The rules are as currently stated by our archivist, and the Tribunal governs this court according to my wishes. No more of this. If you merely wanted one of my kisses, you could have asked. Or at least showboated with better splendor.
## Gosleigh (03/14/04)

I'm still trying to contact my master Celarus ... to have someone of knowledge and power in this place ... and to get me out of here ...

By the way, when I contact him -- Nael suggested that his madness had something to do with Sheogorath's distraction ... would it be good if I had my master remove that? Would it be better to have Nael's sanity back, and Sheogorath ... undistracted?
## Gosleigh (03/14/04)

Well, I've had no luck contacting him thus far, and I've been trying. You have plenty of time I imagine to decide whether you'd like Nael lucid again and the chance of the Mad God peeking in on this court, or the situation to continue as it has.

Of course, since the Prince of Insanity is -- bizarre as it may sound -- Vehk's character witness, I will request His awful presence if the indubitably guilty former-God requests it.
## Gosleigh (03/15/04)

I will continue my efforts to contact Celarus ... he must still be in conference with the Emperor ...
## God_of_Worms (03/15/04)

I understand there is a strange and disturbing aura emitting from Azura's Star?

I would take precaution were I the handler of this device. I know of this soul, and of the soul it is linked to. A sensual and alluring angel of mortal blood, but not to be taken lightly. A Siren she can, and will be. Her song will bring this gathering only more trouble, for her prison is the only barrier between she and another Shadow is mischief and disaster. To welcome her voice is to welcome the Love that she is forbidden to have.

Do what you will with the Star, but stay to your task and do not stray. Straying will only draw the Shadow of Oblivion ever more present.
## Gosleigh (03/15/04)
Allerleirauh: As has been noted before, Ainoryl has gone to unusual lengths to ensure that the court is protected from any unpleasant consequences of the summoning of Azura.

Has he? I didn't know about that. Perhaps it's because of his protective magic that I've been unable to connect minds with my master Celarus. I will step outside the Hall and try again outside the scope of his enchantments.
## Gosleigh (03/15/04)

I was just stepping out when I heard this. I am no worshipper of daedra, but I'm puzzled by Corsai Akilae Mun'kiel's seemingly naive question about Azura.
Corsai Akilae Mun'kiel: Tell me Tegger, is it all that neccessary for the High Priest Ainoryl to require such a quantity of relics when all that is needed to summon Azura is her star? Why must we present gifts to Azura if she truly loves us?

In answer, I quote from "Invocation of Azura":
Every Hogithum, which we celebrate on the 21st of First Seed, we summon her for guidance, as well as to offer things or worth and beauty to Her Majesty.

The more we want of Azura, the more we should be prepared to give, it seems to me.

Now, I must briefly say goodbye while I speak to my master Celarus.
## Ainoryl (03/16/04)

Greetings again.

Firstly, thank you Gosleigh, for so politely pointing out the passage from the text "Invocation of Azura."

I would request that, in the future, should anyone take issue with my doings to bring the matter to me personally.

Now, why I have come. I am fairly certain that I have identified the soul within Azura's Star. I am absolutely certain that the soul is of what was once a mortal female. The soul itself is not overly powerful, but there is at least a latent connection established with something of significance. For some reason, Arkay's Blessing did not apply. I do not know how this happened. I must work at the gem a little more, I appreciate all of your patience.

It is now my most humble request, that I might have a word with Lord Fyr, and acquire his oppinion on these matters. Perhaps you may shed some light on this mystery.. will you speak with me?
## Ainoryl (03/16/04)
Corsai Akilae Mun'kiel: Tell me Tegger, is it all that neccessary for the High Priest Ainoryl to require such a quantity of relics when all that is needed to summon Azura is her star? Why must we present gifts to Azura if she truly loves us?

I belive this question (which was asked on multiple occasions) should have been brought to me personally. I do not see much "Overall concern" in it, as much as I see an uninformed accusation. But, as for overall concern? I do not understand what assurance you are looking for. What exactly is there a danger of? I assure you, I am capable of handling the artifact. The soul is not going anywhere. If that changes, you all will be the first to know. I already stated that your health is not in danger. I suppose, if it may ease your minds, I will say that the star is far from this hall, and very secure. As the presiding priest, I will of course provide protection to the hall when needed.

And that time of need, has not yet come. There is no extra force needed within these halls. It has been some time since the passing of Seht and the daedra princes do not walk among us. This summoning will be no different, in that respect.

I do not act alone. I have the consent of the Tribunal, and Vehks blessing. I work alongside all of them.

Contrary to what seems to be the popular belief, the preparations for the invocation are going extremely well.
## Divayth Fyr the Psijic (03/17/04)

My good Ainoryl, it is good to speak with you once again. I must admit, I wish the circumstances were different, but nevertheless, it is just.

If you wish to gain consultation with me regarding this shroud upon Azura's Star, I would have you know that I know very little. The Star has never been in my possession to study. Only text and rumor relay it's origins and meanings to me. Now that I am near however, I do sense a malicious trickery entombed. Mannimarco appears to lay on a thick warning concerning the contents. Is it that even He fears what is slumbering within? It is true that the esteemed God of Worms has no love for Love, and I sense a great emmination of Love trapped within. Or is it Lust? To be sure, I urge you to stay steadfast on your task to use the Star for the summoning ONLY. Do not stray or you may reveal what this hidden mystery is, and if Mannimarco lays forth a warning, I do hope myself, that we do not disturb this Niche of Unknown.
## Ainoryl (03/17/04)

As always, Lord Fyr, your insight and oppinion is most appreciated. I am also happy to speak with you again, and look forward to a time when we might talk more at ease.

Your warning, and Mannimarco's, is indeed, most dire. I must take consideration on this matter, for it is a complicated decision. It is my unfortunate task to uncover what slumbers within the star, for if this soul is unpleasing in presentation to Azura, the summoning may have been in vain. However, I do not wish to unleash something malicious and powerfull, and so I assure you and all gathered here that the utmost care will be taken in my research. Thank you again Lord Fyr, for your input.
## Divayth Fyr the Psijic (03/18/04)

Is there a way? Why yes, of course, but even a glimpse into the Star can be dangerous. The very person that peers beyond the Here to There could be at risk of being drawn in themselves, IF this Other entity were to commit. A sort of, trading places mind you. It is quite simple to gaze into this item, but not knowing the power on the Other side is the real pickle. Even though I sense Sadness and Love from within, those are not emotions to be taken lightly. Do not let your pity get the best of your senses. I also sense Mischief and Trickery. I urge you, there is no need to bother this soul. Commit to your summoning with the item and no harm shall be done. Tamper deeper into it more than you must, and there is no telling what forgotten soul you may awaken.

I can tell you this....

There is One here who knows of the soul within. I believe the reason He is not coming forth with the information is for your protection. To know what is inside, is to lust for more. Tamper not and question not! Remember your task and remain to it, and no harm will come!
## God_of_Worms (03/18/04)

Ah, Master Divayth, always ever the watchdog. Do not speak of that which you do not have knowlege of. I lay down a thick warning? Oh no, by all means, I urge this Tribunal to put their curiosity to rest and release the soul within the Star. For it is not I who has to tend to whatever is awakened. Ever curious mortals have a weakness for tampering with the unknown. I say, let the pieces fall where they may.

If you are referring to me when you speak of One who knows what is entombed, I will admit that I do. Nor do I care. It was not I who created this prison for that mortal wench. Nor is it I who cares who she is or whether she deserved such a "hospitable" tomb. Sad? Indeed she is. For, you too would be sad knowing your soul is bound to such an instrument. Love? That is another story all in itself. Her Love is her business, and is not created for our amusement. She is of no concern to this Tribunal, or any other outside of this assembly. If need be, as your weakness of "curiosity" dictates, ask the One, Azura, to deliver you an answer to this soul within the Star. She too, I am sure, will find it utterly unecessary to answer such petty inquiries.

I urge the Court to address this issue as a deterant from the case at hand.
## Vehk (03/19/04)

To those assembled:

Please forgive my absence. With the imminent summoning, and the nature of the judgment no doubt rendered shortly thereafter, I've had to settle some affairs. Some of these were centuries old, or supraterrestrial, or both. To those clamoring for my punishment, know that these errands were the first: how odd it is to recall the memory of debt.
## Sheogorath (03/19/04)
Attrebus: and that Sheogorath's distraction is once again in place.

Oh yes, then why am I breathing mist at your window?

Don't fear, you will not hear from me again. I will give the stage to my sister. There will be time enough for my solo later.

Goodnight, my darling dears.
## God_of_Worms (03/19/04)

To perhaps set some minds at rest on this matter, it matters not who is entombed in the Star. It is a soul of no importance to this Tribunal. It has no meaning to inquisition. It is best left to be.

Your "Nerevarine", had no play in this soul being imprisoned in the Star. The Star was already quite aged even at the time of the "murdered" Hortator. The enchantment was inset long before.

As I said previously, this soul has no meaning to the situation at hand. I am sure, that if Azura cares enough to offer any insight to this soul, she will see to it. I would not put much effort into such a petty inquiry however.

I now have some personal affairs to attend to, so I must take leave. I do hope to return for the final judgement.

✶Allerleirauh arrives, wearing a white gown, very simple in design, and formal, to honor Azura.

Before we begin, I would like to address all present regarding the safety of the Hall, and its inhabitants, during the summoning.

I believe that the Hall is as safe as it can reasonably be made. However, it is foolish to pretend that the summoning of Azura, and the visitations of other great powers, are predictable and controllable situations. I notice that tegger has accepted the help of additional warriors for the defense of the Hall, but I must urge everyone, if anything should go catastrophically wrong, to flee the Hall as quickly as possible.
## Vehk (03/21/04)

Mercy, you are slick with discomfort. I smell it. Is it the sight of me, like this, that brings dew to the lily? Or some deeper reaction, made by this sudden house, the rut-need before fear? To this, I say two things: I cannot oblige you, white gown notwithstanding, and: there is no place for worry. Only Dunmer die today.
## Ainoryl (03/21/04)

✶Ainoryl returns, robed as a priest of the Tribunal Temple.

Greetings to the appointed Tribunal, and to the High Council. Vivec, glorious Warrior-Poet of Vvardenfell, Tribune and Lord of of Veloth, greetings.

✶Ainoryl bows to the five quarters.

The summoning will take time. The proper sigils must be set in place, the oils prepared, the incense lit.

✶Ainoryl begins his preparations. Suddenly, he winces and rubs his chest again through his robes. He coughs, and a light appears from his mouth, as if he were lit from within. He manages to stifle both this and the cough with a hand before someone sees. He hopes.

## Vehk (03/22/04)

Rude spirit, you should never have come. Not here. Not to the world of the liars, where your power is fleshed to law, bound by the bones of the compromise.

Shallow changer, whorescamp, say you that you rule dusk and dawn?

Let me show you the power of the true Dawn, when Gods walked.

## Ainoryl (03/22/04)

✶ Ainoryl invokes some incantation and removes robes. His chest is stitched together, and a reddish light begins to emanate from inside him, his ribs and organs showing through in negative.
## Vehk (03/22/04)

✶A shadow leaves Vivec, snapping off him to wrap around the Daedra Lord, cracking the air as it stiffens.

With my Charges I put you down.

By this Shadow, I call your neonymic forth, your chosen throne, sundown and sunrise, death and birth of shadow. You are bound to this place.

How does it feel, Lord Azura? To so fully manifest here is the Mundus, stripped down only to your name?

Perhaps it feels a bit like my sister did, when your machinations split her, name from land, nymic eth maliache velot, thoughtless save for domain.

These are my people, Azura. See how they serve? You should have stayed replaced.

✶Vehk nods to Nigedo, his bravest.

Nigedo, curse this heshe-bitch as she has done our people.
## Vehk (03/22/04)

By this Lover, I call your protonymic forth, your secret throne, youth and return, the lover's morning, the loved one's end. You are buried in this place.
## Spirit_from_the_Star (03/22/04)

✶A shape unfolds from within Azura's Star and coalesces into a lovely female form.

And so, the last of those you called "False Gods" seeks his revenge against you, Azura; you, false to me, false to all my people, petty and vengeful spirit, enemy of all my happiness. It is I, Azura, I whom you never thought to see again. You swore in the Halls of Oblivion that no mortal such as I was worthy to be paired with a Prince of the Daedra. You thought, by binding me within this prison of your own invention, to place me forever beyond the reach of one who can transcend the bounds of life and death - my love, my soul - to stop even my rebirth into the world in another form, lest we two find one another again.

You have lost and I have won. But what I have suffered at your hands I will not forget, not though I die a thousand deaths and live a thousand lifetimes. It is your turn, Azura, Mother of the Blasted Canker, Stain upon the Night Sky, Prince of nothing but your own envy. May you be cast into outermost darkness and uttermost cold. May you cry out to those who loved you and hear nothing, not even your own voice. Never again show yourself in this fair form to the mortal fools who have been your slaves; and let what is offered to you be carried, steaming and redolent of spices, to my Lord's table. My Lord, my lover who would never have forsaken me, Clavicus Vile!

✶To Attrebus: a thousand scribs swarm his body at a glance.

✶To Azura:

There now. Better. How does one feel when weighted down by their heaviest of mysteries? When one gazes into their soul and sees their own eyes staring back? Perhaps it's how my brother felt, folding into himself like a prism until your darts were thrown, nymic sel sulimet elhnodidan, thought thinking thought.

AE ALTADOON DUNMERI for my brother's wasting I eat you.

## Vehk (03/22/04)

✶To B: the shells of the dead scribs form shapes of the Temple saints. B and Attrebus fall to their knees and weep blood.

✶To Azura:

✶Vehk draws forth the antlers, breaking off one of its bloodied tips.

Recognize this? The blood, I mean, not the silly bone-frozen Bosmer. No? It's from one of yours. He died in your name.

And so by the blood of this khajiit, I climb you, moon and moon, and Dance on your Tower.

AE CHIM CE ALTADOON for my own revenge I eat you. AE CHIM CE ALTADOON for my own revenge I eat you.

✶Vehk assembles a spear from the bones of his armor.

Here, this is Muatra. Guess what it represents.

HA HA HA HA HA HA

I give my thanks to all assembled, my dumb, deaf dreamers! You've proven a convicing ruse for so long now! I would ask that you bear me no ill will for my use of you, but I am Vivec, born of powers which should have forever been unalike, Vehk and Vehk, murderer of the last and last, anon ALMSIVI, whose name is Alive, and so really do

not

care!

HA HA HA HA HA HA

My vengeance on this prophesying harlot has waited an age! I am DONE!

Good night, my whirling, my snowskin, my silent doubter! Good night, the dead! Good night, the law! Good night, the madness and the worm! Good night, scholar and sword! Good night all who have spoken or lurked or cast stone! Good night, for Vehk and Vehk shall speak here NO MORE!

This was my last gift to all of you, which as they all have ever been, was a gift unto MYSELF!

The time of the Empire is come!

Good night!

Farewell!

I am VIVEC.
## Vehk (03/22/04)

Oh, yes, the ringlet. What was this for, you might wonder. Here:

✶places ringlet in his mouth, and a Voice issues out.

He was not born a god.

His destiny did not lead him to this crime.

He chose this path of his own free will.

He stole the godhood and murdered the Hortator.

✶removes ringlet

Thanks so much for playing along and pretty much making Elder Scrolls fans the coolest, smartest, canniest CRPG fans anywhere.

You guys rock.
## WormGod (03/22/04)

Fun stuff. Glad everyone was a good sport about participation.

Who knows what might pop up next. Just gotta keep your eyes open, I guess.

Till then, the God of Worms must be put back up on the shelf, with His ever watchful eye open.
## Sheogorath (03/24/04)
MK: You guys rock.

OOC: I second that emotion. You guys made it fun.
## Attrebus (03/24/04)

Ah Shiggy, I don't know where you come up with that crazy stuff that you write, but it's great fun to read!

And you tried to make me go insane.
## Sheogorath (03/24/04)
Attrebus: And you tried to make me go insane.

And damn near succeeded too. Heh heh.

You'll be glad to know that Gosleigh stopped running on the High Rock / Cyrodiil border, and is sleeping off the visions he had of deicide.
