## Background
### History
When the [[chimer|Chimer]] were led by the triune Good Daedra into the old land of [[veloth|Veloth]], each Daedra Lord fostered their own group of priests and priestesses. After entering Veloth, the High Velothi Culture eventually dwindled into tribal nature which finally emerged as early versions of the modern Dunmer Houses. Among these houses were the holy Daedric Houses, which included House Boethiah, House Mephala and, most importantly to this mod, [[house-azura|House Azura]]. For many generations, the Minor Houses led the Great Houses in worship of the Good Daedra. However, when the Tribunal ascended to godhood and replaced the old traditions of ancestor and Daedra worship, the priestly Minor Houses began to fall out of favor in the emerging Great House and Dunmer Temple culture.  
  
Azura heard the cries of her persecuted House and legends portray her performing [[the-translation|The Translation]] to "create" the Azurian Isles for her devout House. When she was finished, Azura gathered all of House Azura and brought them to the isles. Where they have dwelt for the past 3000 years.

*(Azura's "creation" of the isles is possibly only folk-lore but don't bring that up with a House Azura zealot!)*
  
House Azura is sanctioned into two easily definable divisions: The House Azura Government and the Sacred [[rosery-of-azura|Rosery]]. The Rosery is the modern representation of the ancient priestly lines, while House Azura resembles modern Great Houses more in structure and government, led by the Magnate and the members of the Rose Council.
### Religion
Azura is the primary deity worshiped by House Azura; they respect the other daedra but do not worship them. The old ways of ancestor worship are also an integral part of worship and communing in the isles. Ancestral tombs, minor ghost fences, and Waiting Doors are common in the Isles.
### Geography
The Azurian Isles are a large archipelago located far to the southeast of Vvardenfell Island, and beyond the mainland of Morrowind in the Padomaic Ocean between Tamriel and Akavir. The lush, tropical Azurian Isles Region dominates the archipelago. To the south, the traditionally named [[thousand-isles|Thousand Isles]] are inhabited by the separatist [[ouamer|Ouamer]] tribe of Chimer.
