> [!CITE] [[azura|Azura]]
> [[azura|Azura]] was the ancestor who taught the [[chimer|Chimer]] how to be different from the Altmer. Her teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, [[azura|Azura]] is often encountered more as a communal progenitor of the race as a whole rather than as an individual ancestor. She is associated with Dusk and Dawn, and is sometimes called the [[azura|Mother Soul]]. Azura's Star, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of the Steed. [[azura|Azura]] is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy.
