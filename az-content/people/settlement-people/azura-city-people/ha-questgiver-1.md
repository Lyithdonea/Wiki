| Azura                  |             | Azura’s sphere is dusk and dawn, the magic in-between realms of twilight, known as Moonshadow. She is called by many names: Mother of the Rose, and Queen of the Night Sky.                                                                                           |
| Ouag Tong              |             | Oh, you mean the Shell-mongers? Those fishy smelling water-lovers reek to Oblivion! If you must find them, they control an island down in the Thousand Isles region, though I wouldn’t suggest going there. I hear they feed their unfaithful to the Slaughtersharks. |
| Ouamer                 |             | House Azura resides in peace with the Ouamer. However, they stubbornly refuse to acknowledge their beginnings by not affiliating with the House. They prefer to dwindle into simple living in their shacks and brick hovels.                                          |
| Invocation of Currents |             | The Invocation is the initiation rite of the Ouag Tong. The exact details of its methods are a guarded secret. But what I do know is that the novitiates who walk away alive from the rite are blessed with many abilities inherent to the Tong.                      |
| Refulgent Erudites     | Random < 25 | The Refulgent Erudites are the knight-philosophers of the Jealous Branch in the Rosery here in Lyithdonea.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Refulgent Erudites     | Random < 50 | If you are heading up to the Rosery District you shouldn’t have to look far for an Erudite. They protect the Tenets of Azura. Especially those pertaining to House Azura's claim of descent from the Twilit Lady.                                                     |
| Refulgent Erudites     | Random < 75 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rosery of Azura        |             | The priests and priestesses of the Rosery maintain intimate relationships with our Mother of the Rose, assuring her favor of our House.                                                                                                                               |
