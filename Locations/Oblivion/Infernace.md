Infernace is a pocket realm of [Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Oblivion "Lore:Oblivion"). It is a realm of extreme heat and molten rock, and is the home of the [Flame Atronachs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Flame_Atronach "Lore:Flame Atronach"). It is well known to all [conjurers](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Conjuration "Lore:Conjuration") due to the ability to summon subservient atronachs from the realm. The [Fourth Sinus of Takubar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fourth_Sinus_of_Takubar "Lore:Fourth Sinus of Takubar"), a realm of extreme cold, is an inversion of Infernace.

Despite being considered a highly-organized and physical realm, the reality of Infernace is not a projection of the mind of any particular [Daedra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedra "Lore:Daedra"). Instead, it was created as an extension of its Flame Atronach inhabitants. Realms such as Infernace are termed 'collective realms', and are considered relatively exceptional. However, collective realms are also rather mundane and uniform, and the endless magma and fumaroles of Infernace are no exception.

The clan structure of Infernace is unknown, and no hierarchy has been observed due to the difficulties involved in distinguishing individual Flame Atronachs. The realm may have come under the rule of [Mehrunes Dagon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mehrunes_Dagon "Lore:Mehrunes Dagon") during the invasion of the [Battlespire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Battlespire "Lore:Battlespire"), when the Flame Atronachs swore allegiance to [Shardai Clan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shardai_Clan "Lore:Shardai Clan").

The ancient [Chimer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Chimer "Lore:Chimer") used ensorcelled gates to conjure atronach from Infernace.

By nature of not having a direct Prince presiding over it, doors to Oblivion are often opened to collective realms like Infernace as a starting point from Mundus as its boundaries are easier to pierce.
