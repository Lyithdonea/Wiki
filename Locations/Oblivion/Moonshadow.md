_"Too much beauty [...] I am half blind. I see flowers and waterfalls, majestic trees, a city of silver, but it is all a blur. The colors run like water. It's raining now, and the wind smells like perfume. This surely is Moonshadow, where Azura dwells."_ — Morian Zenas, from Seif-ij Hidja's _[The Doors of Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Doors_of_Oblivion "Lore:The Doors of Oblivion")_

Moonshadow is a realm of [Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Oblivion "Lore:Oblivion") created and ruled over by the [Daedric Prince](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes "Lore:Daedric Princes") [Azura](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Azura "Lore:Azura"), Queen of Dawn and Dusk.[1](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-TDOO-1)[2](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-MH-2) The realm is said to hold "too much beauty", so much so it can render mortal visitors "half-blind", and contain flowers, waterfalls, pink trees,[3](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-RF-3) and a city of silver. Azura herself resides in a rose palace, and is welcoming to mortal travelers.[1](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-TDOO-1)

To the [Khajiit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit "Lore:Khajiit"), Moonshadow is where [Azurah](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Azurah "Lore:Azurah") tends the Gates of the Crossing—the bridge between Nirni and the afterlife beyond.[4](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-ONMM-4)[5](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-ONSR-5) According to myth, as Azurah wept in the [Great Darkness](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Void "Lore:Void") after the death of her [mother](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fadomai "Lore:Fadomai"), the light from her tears chased away the Darkness and eventually left a "place of moonlight and shadow".[6](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-TFDOF-6) Khajiiti mythology also writes that when [Magrus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Magrus "Lore:Magrus") fled from [Boethra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Boethra "Lore:Boethra") and [Lorkhaj](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lorkhaj "Lore:Lorkhaj") after the former had plucked his eye out,[7](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-TWS-7) he fell into the Moonshadow. There, Azurah judged him as too fearful to rule a sphere, and tore out his other eye. The blinded Magrus fled to the [heavens](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aetherius "Lore:Aetherius"), and Azurah made of his eye a "stone to reflect the [Varliance Gate](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varliance_Gate "Lore:Varliance Gate")".[8](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-TSS-8)

During the [Second Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era "Lore:Second Era"), the [Ashlander](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ashlander "Lore:Ashlander") inhabitants of [Ald'ruhn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ald%27ruhn "Lore:Ald'ruhn") had come into possession of several Crimson Shards of Moonshadow, large red crystals which glow with a powerful red light.[9](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-9) Rose foundation is made from the pink petals of flowering trees in the realm and imported to Tamriel.[3](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-RF-3) Several pieces of armor of Daedric quality found in [Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel "Lore:Tamriel") are thought to have originated from Moonshadow; they are enchanted with a strong magical light enchantment, but are otherwise unremarkable.[10](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-OBArtifacts-10)

#### History
During [Morian Zenas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Morian_Zenas "Lore:Morian Zenas") and [Divayth Fyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divayth_Fyr "Lore:Divayth Fyr")'s experiments to travel to Oblivion between [2E 418](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era#2E_418 "Lore:Second Era") to [2E 431](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era#2E_431 "Lore:Second Era"), they managed to figure out a ritual to open a gate to Oblivion. Zenas decided to try going to Moonshadow as it was a safe option and visited the realm,[11](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-CM:8-11) but then went on to various other realms before settling in [Apocrypha](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Apocrypha "Lore:Apocrypha").[1](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-TDOO-1)[12](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-CM:10-12) He described Moonshadow to his assistant, [Seif-ij Hidja](https://en.uesp.net/w/index.php?title=Lore:Seif-ij_Hidja&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lore:Seif-ij Hidja (page does not exist)").[13](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-CM:14-13)

A rift to Moonshadow opened within [Scrivener's Hall](https://en.uesp.net/w/index.php?title=Lore:Scrivener%27s_Hall&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lore:Scrivener's Hall (page does not exist)") on 2nd Hearthfire, [2E 571](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era#2E_571 "Lore:Second Era"), and closed two years later on 25th Evening Star, [2E 573](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era#2E_573 "Lore:Second Era").[14](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-MRT-14)

Following [Vivec](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vivec "Lore:Vivec")'s indecent acts toward Azura at Hogithum Hall in the [Imperial City](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_City "Lore:Imperial City"), Azura had made the regular gateways to the realm inaccessible by [3E 432](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third_Era#3E_432 "Lore:Third Era").[UOL 1](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moonshadow#cite_note-ICDL-15)
