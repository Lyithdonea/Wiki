**Faction:**
[[Mages Guild]], Exarch-Mage

**Location:** 
[[Dor Dalla]], Guild of Mages

**Background:**
Zalaster was previously a high ranking and adequately skilled mage in High Rock who petitioned to take over the chapterhouse in Lyithdonea after the unfortunate demise of the last Exarch-Mage. His request and (on paper anyway) promotion was granted in part due to the aggravation he had caused some peers with his reckless behavior. So he was put somewhere out of the way. He does have a lot of experience with summoning daedra, so he is qualified for the job.

**Personality:**
An excitable fellow who is not very cautious. He has a passionate desire to learn, experiment, and trust novices with dangerous duties. His associates are frustrated by the reckless behavior he often encourages with students.
