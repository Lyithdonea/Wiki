**Motivations (Main Storyline):**
Ester is one of the ascended [[Nolmer]] and is at odds with her father [[Aesmandroth]] (he is not fully aware of her betrayal at the outset of the story). Although she sympathizes with him and has no love for Azura, she does not think that his methods for creating her race or attacking [[House Azura]] are justified.
