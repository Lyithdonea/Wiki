| Azura           |        | Azura was the ancestor who taught the Chimer how to be different from the Altmer. Her teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often encountered more as a communal progenitor of the race as a whole rather than as an individual ancestor. She is associated with Dusk and Dawn, and is sometimes called the Mother Soul. Azura's Star, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of the Steed. Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy. |
| Lyithdonea      |        | Lyithdonea is the Maormeri name for the Azurian Isles. It was adopted into use during the Hlamola Encounter. Not having any knowledge of their language, we are not sure what it really means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rosery of Azura |        | Although all of House Azura is founded on the veneration of Azura, the Rosery leads the worship of the Lady.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
