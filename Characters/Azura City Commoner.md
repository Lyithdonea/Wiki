| Refulgent Erudites | Chimer == 0             | Have you ever tried speaking with a Refulgent Erudite? Some of the words that come out of their mouth...I can’t understand a thing they say! I’ve heard that their training removes self-thought; they only think in terms of words and grammar so they can perfectly execute the law. |

| Rosery District    | Cell != Rosery District | If you need to go there, it’s just up the hill if you go through the palace grounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
