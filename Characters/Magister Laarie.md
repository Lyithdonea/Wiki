**Faction:**
[[Mages Guild]], Master of Incunabula

**Location:** 
[[Dor Dalla]], Pneumological Studies

**Background:**
Laarie and Jusenna were in Lyithdonea serving under the previous Exarch-Mage before Zalaster's arrival. They are research partners with the most vested interest in the isles themselves. Laarie is an enchanter with a strong focus in pneumology, the study of souls / soul energy. Her interest in Lyithdonea is related to the metaphysical link between Lyithdonea and Moonshadow and how that affects the spiritual attunement of people and creatures in the isles.

**Personality:**
As with most High Elves, Laarie is somewhat aloof. And also distracted by her research. She's more of a conversationalist than Jusenna, but not by much.
