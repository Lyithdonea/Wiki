#### Faction
[[Mages Guild]], Master of Incunabula

#### Location
[[Dor Dalla]], Pneumological Studies
#### Background
Laarie and Jusenna were in Lyithdonea serving under the previous Exarch-Mage before Zalaster's arrival. They are research partners with the most vested interest in the isles themselves. Laarie is an enchanter with a strong focus in pneumology, the study of souls / soul energy. Her interest in Lyithdonea is related to the metaphysical link between Lyithdonea and Moonshadow and how that affects the spiritual attunement of people and creatures in the isles.

Enchant/Librarian/Pneumology
#### Personality
As with most High Elves, Laarie is somewhat aloof. And also distracted by her research. She's more of a conversationalist than Jusenna, but not by much.

| Dor Dalla                       |                    | Dor Dalla is the island this guildhall was built on. Due to the fact that we operate outside of the Empire's official domain, this place is like a microcosm of the guild back on the continent.                                                                                                           |
| House Azura                     |                    | House Azura rules Lyithdonea. At least the northern region. The Islanders, or Ouamer, live in the southern swamps which House Azura mostly avoids.                                                                                                                                                         |
