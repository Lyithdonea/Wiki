Airan is someone who might show up in [[Moonshadow]] if he is blessed by [[Azura]]: "An Ashlander says there is a place called 'Airan's Teeth' in the Valley of the Wind. Two rocks spires mark the entrance to the Valley of the Wind, and they bear the name of the seer, Airan, who is blessed by [[Azura]]. These might be the 'teeth of the wind'. The Valley of the Wind is a valley on the northeast slopes of Red Mountain."
