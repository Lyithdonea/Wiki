[[Mages Guild]] is mainly here to study the interesting feature of this archipelago that the barriers seem to be relatively loose between it and Oblivion (the 6th barrier).

[[Magister Jusenna]] and [[Magister Reeh-Fen]] are interested in the Shrine of the 9th [[Barrier]].

Have the player clean up alchemy spills in the alchemy lab.

**Bow of Twilight**
[[Magister Zalaster]] sends the player to speak with [[Magister Jusenna]], the guild’s expert on Oblivion. She wants the player to locate the Bow of Twilight. Which is an artifact of Azura which is said to be able to penetrate the liminal boundaries (fueled by Azura’s First Secret power). She says that the bow was last seen in the daedric ruins of Julairan according to her sources.
