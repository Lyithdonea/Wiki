Sent to retrieve the rest of the maps. The knowledge of these locations is based mostly on rumors and conjecture.

* Get some treasure maps from black pirates, some from guild members, some from people in the city (like a retired imperial soldier in the capitol with ties to the pirates).
* Find and get key fragments from each of the treasure chests.
	- The treasure maps are zoomed in versions of Londonrookâ€™s map (he made one of Lyithdonea) so that you have to figure out where they are based on a big map in the guildhall
	- Some treasure chests are buried and require a shovel to dig up
