**The Violescent Blade**
The player must travel to Bnay, city of the Ouamer to win their trust. After conferring with the wise women, the player is sent to eliminate a necromancer which has taken over the ruined settlement of Tarshon. They do this (running into Ester who is trying to stop Aesmandrothâ€™s minions from stealing the blade to unbind it and weaken Azura). Together, they defeat the sload necromancer and take the blade back to the Ouamer who name them Warrior-Protector.

* Need a new hook for the blade + Tarshon if this is not used. Could change this to a high level misc quest for the Ouamer.

**Rite of the Warrior-Protector**
After being elected Warrior-Protector of House Azura and the Ouamer, the player must attend the ritual to be accepted into the House Azura family lines. This is conducted at the ruins of Azularrabel - the old holy site before Azura City was constructed and House Azura and the Ouamer split up. Following the rite, the player is awarded with an estate island (recently vacated by an abducted and presumed dead nobleman). At this time, many shrines and tombs are activated for the player so that he/she can now converse with the ancestors of the entire House Azura. And the Ouamer invite the player to combat in their arena to test their strength when the conflict is over.

* This is WAY to derivative of the Hortator thing. But need a use for Azularrabel in the MQ.
