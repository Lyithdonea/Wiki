Before hiring the player, the questgiver wants them to investigate a scuffle down in the City Underworks to prove their worth. Someone is dead and the killer is no where to be found. The disturbing thing is the bloodless state of the corpse. Interview nearby observers for clues (spoiler: it was cult activity). Report back.

At this point, the questgiver will offer to hire the player but this is optional. If they do, it will kick off the House Azura questline with [[HAQ1]].

Next: [[MQ4]]
