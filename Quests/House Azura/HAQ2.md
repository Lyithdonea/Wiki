When the player returns, [[HA Questgiver 2]] has another request: for the player to travel to Jubuka'im Farm. The owner, Vuldo, has been price gouging since he's operating one of the only mills in the isles and the House has issued a sanction against him under threat that House Azura will take ownership of his farm if he doesn't adhere to the established prices (you get an option to help Vuldo rebuff this accusation because prices have been fixed for decades and he's close to going under).

[[HA Questgiver 2]] promotes the player to Retainer, gives them a key to an apartment they can reside in free of charge for 2 weeks while they get their affairs in order (standard process for new Retainers). After which point, the player can continue paying for the apartment if they so choose. Says to return in a day or after they have finished getting moved in.
