Busy work (not MQ focused): HA Questgiver says that a noble in the manor district has asked for protection while he and his entourage make their annual visit to their ancestral tomb. They meet you at the docks, you take a boat, and then they travel there. You get to leave them there, because screw escort quests.

HA Questgiver asks if you're interested in joining HA as a hireling because of your excellent work. He has more important work than just being a strongarm but he needs your agreement to adhere to the laws of the House.

He wants you to deliver a message, but more importantly introduce yourself to an individual in the Rosery. The prophet, Rashyon Daga. Who you know is important in Azura!
